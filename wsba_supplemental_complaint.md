## **FACTUAL BASIS - COORDINATED REPRESENTATION INTERFERENCE**

### **A. August 12, 2025 Transcript Evidence (01:01:01)**

**Dexter Callahan's Admission Under Oath**:
> *"Mr. Mr. Rongerud had been in contact with me. **We had an agreement** while reserving my request for fees regarding the contempt motion due to the response, **we had to prepare to strike that hearing**."*

**Legal Significance**: Opposing counsel admits coordination with client's attorney to strike valid contempt proceedings without client knowledge or consent.

### **B. Professional Conduct Violations**

**1. RPC 1.7(a)(2) - Conflict of Interest (Rongerude)**
- **Standard**: Representation limited by lawyer's other responsibilities
- **Violation**: Made agreement with opposing counsel prioritizing case management over client enforcement rights
- **Evidence**: Transcript admission of "agreement" to strike hearing

**2. RPC 8.4(d) - Conduct Prejudicial to Administration of Justice (Both Attorneys)**
- **Standard**: Conduct that undermines integrity of legal system
- **Violation**: Coordinated abandonment of valid court proceedings through inter-attorney agreement

**3. RPC 1.4(a)(3) - Informed Client Decision-Making (Rongerude)**
- **Standard**: Keep client reasonably informed about status of matter
- **Violation**: Failed to disclose coordination agreement with opposing counsel
- **Evidence**: Client learned of agreement through opposing counsel's court admission

### **C. Timeline of Coordinated Misconduct**

**August 5-7, 2025**: 
- Rongerude presents ultimatum to client: strike contempt hearing or lose representation
- Client agrees under duress without knowledge of coordination with opposing counsel

**August 7, 2025**: 
- Rongerude files withdrawal motion after implementing coordination agreement
- Timing ensures client medical emergency coincides with representation loss

**August 12, 2025**:

- Coordination revealed only through opposing counsel's court statement

**August 13, 2025**: 
- Client undergoes emergency brain surgery day after forced hearing attendance
- Medical emergency exploitation enabled by coordinated representation abandonment

## **AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES**

### **A. Medical Emergency Exploitation**

- Client faced life-threatening brain surgery August 13, 2025
- Doctor's orders prohibited high-stress situations prior to surgery
- Attorney coordination forced client participation in contested hearing day before surgery

### **B. Protection Order Enforcement Abandonment**

- Valid contempt proceedings against protection order violations
- RCW 7.105.450 enforcement mechanisms deliberately abandoned
- Client's safety interests subordinated to attorney coordination convenience

### **C. Systematic Deception Pattern**

- Client informed of attorney "breakdown" rather than coordination
- Opposing counsel reveals coordination through court admission
- Client discovers true circumstances only through transcript review

## **PROFESSIONAL DISCIPLINE REQUESTED**

### **A. John Rongerude - OPD Attorney**

**Violations**: RPC 1.4(a)(3), RPC 1.7(a)(2), RPC 8.4(d)
**Discipline**: Professional sanctions for client abandonment through opposing counsel coordination

### **B. Dexter L. Callahan - WSBA #53119**

**Violations**: RPC 8.4(d), potential RPC 4.2 implications

## **SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION**

**Exhibit B**: Medical Documentation - Brain surgery scheduling and doctor's orders  
**Exhibit C**: August 7, 2025 Withdrawal Filing - Timing coordination evidence  
**Exhibit D**: Client Communications - Evidence of duress-based agreement  

## **RELIEF REQUESTED**

### **Immediate Disciplinary Action**:

1. **Investigation** of coordinated representation interference
2. **Professional sanctions** proportional to systematic misconduct
3. **Client protection measures** preventing future coordination without consent
4. **Restitution** for damages caused by coordinated abandonment

### **Systemic Protections**:

1. **Clear guidance** on attorney coordination limitations in contested matters
2. **Client notification requirements** for any opposing counsel communications
3. **Medical emergency protocols** preventing exploitation of vulnerable clients

## **CONCLUSION**

The August 12, 2025 transcript provides irrefutable evidence of coordinated attorney misconduct designed to abandon valid court proceedings during a client medical emergency. Dexter Callahan's sworn admission of an "agreement" with John Rongerude to "strike that hearing" demonstrates systematic coordination that violates multiple professional conduct rules.

This conduct undermines the fundamental adversarial system by converting opposing counsel into collaborative case managers without client knowledge or consent. Such coordination is particularly egregious when timed to exploit client medical vulnerabilities.

Professional discipline is essential to protect future clients from similar coordinated representation abandonment and to maintain the integrity of Washington's legal system.
