# Legal Protections for Spouse Removed from AD&D Policy During Dissolution

**William Miller faces immediate, actionable legal remedies under multiple areas of law following Candi Brightwell's admission of canceling AFLAC/Pier 1 AD&D coverage "out of anger" while he was on life support.** The combination of federal ERISA protections, Washington State insurance and family law, corporate fiduciary duties, and contempt procedures provides a comprehensive framework for both emergency relief and long-term recovery.

## Emergency contempt proceedings offer the fastest path to relief

**Contempt of court represents the most immediate remedy available.** Under RCW 26.09.160, violating automatic restraining orders in dissolution proceedings triggers mandatory penalties including attorney fees, civil penalties starting at $100, and potential jail time up to 180 days. **The admission of canceling insurance "out of anger" constitutes bad faith under Washington law**, creating strong grounds for contempt.

**Emergency procedures provide 24-48 hour relief:** Miller can file an emergency motion for temporary restraining order (TRO) in Ex Parte Department, requiring immediate insurance reinstatement and asset freeze. Washington courts treat insurance termination as irreparable harm warranting same-day TRO issuance. The contempt hearing follows within 14-21 days with mandatory attorney fee awards for successful actions.

**Required immediate actions include:** Filing Motion for Contempt Hearing (form FL All Family 165), obtaining Order to Show Cause, and requesting expedited hearing on Family Law Motions Calendar. Personal service on Brightwell is required, with hearings typically scheduled within 2-3 weeks maximum.

## ERISA provides limited but enforceable federal protections

**ERISA Section 205 spousal consent requirements do not apply to most AD&D policies**, but other federal protections remain significant. ERISA's civil enforcement provisions under Section 502(a) allow participants and beneficiaries to sue for denied benefits and fiduciary breaches, with federal court jurisdiction providing additional leverage.

**COBRA continuation rights require specific notification procedures** when spouses lose coverage due to dissolution. Employers must notify plan administrators within 30 days, who must then notify qualified beneficiaries within 44 days of COBRA rights. **Violations trigger daily penalties up to $110 under ERISA Section 502(c)** for document production failures.

**DOL enforcement mechanisms include** civil penalties ranging from 5% to 100% of amounts involved, with both voluntary correction programs and federal litigation available. Recent federal decisions emphasize enhanced protections for participant rights and meaningful communication requirements in claims processes.

## Washington State law creates multiple protection theories

**Committed intimate relationship status under Connell v. Francisco provides property rights equivalent to marriage.** The five-factor test examining continuous cohabitation, relationship duration, purpose, resource pooling, and intent creates presumptive community property rights in insurance benefits. **As business partners in Mud Monkeys Inc, Miller and Brightwell's relationship likely satisfies multiple CIR criteria**, establishing equitable distribution rights.

**Automatic restraining orders under RCW 26.09.060 prohibit transferring, removing, or disposing of property except for necessities.** Insurance cancellation clearly violates these provisions, with violations carrying minimum penalties and mandatory attorney fees. **Washington's asset preservation framework specifically deems such violations as bad faith conduct** warranting enhanced sanctions.

**State insurance regulations reveal enforcement gaps** - while general cancellation notice requirements exist under RCW 48.18.290, no specific mandate requires private insurers to notify removed spouses. However, PEBB program requirements for public employees demonstrate comprehensive notification frameworks that courts may find persuasive for private coverage.

## Corporate fiduciary duties strengthen the case significantly

**Type C corporation officers face ordinary negligence liability** under RCW 23B.08.300, a stricter standard than LLC gross negligence requirements. As corporate partners in Mud Monkeys Inc, both parties owe fiduciary duties regarding insurance as corporate assets. **Insurance manipulation for personal revenge clearly breaches these duties**, creating claims for monetary damages, injunctive relief, and potential receiver appointment.

**Corporate veil piercing theories apply** when insurance benefits are manipulated for personal benefit rather than corporate purposes. Washington's two-part test requires showing corporate form was intentionally used to violate duties and that piercing is necessary to prevent unjustified loss. **The admitted "anger" motivation strengthens veil piercing arguments** by demonstrating intentional abuse of corporate form.

**Conflict of interest provisions under RCW 23B.08.700-735 require full disclosure and approval** for transactions benefiting officers or directors. Insurance arrangements affecting corporate partners require disinterested approval, which Brightwell clearly bypassed through unilateral cancellation.

## Insurance company notification requirements and third-party liability

**AFLAC and Pier 1 may face independent liability** for failing to verify spousal consent or provide adequate notification. While Washington law doesn't mandate spousal notification for private insurers, the combination of corporate ownership structure and dissolution proceedings may create heightened duties.

**ERISA fiduciary standards apply to employer-sponsored AD&D policies**, requiring plan administrators to act prudently and solely in participants' interests. Accepting beneficiary changes without proper verification during known legal proceedings could constitute fiduciary breach.

**Insurance companies must provide policy documents within 30 days** under ERISA Section 502(c), with daily penalties for non-compliance. Obtaining complete policy terms and change procedures will clarify notification requirements and potential violations.

## Coordinated legal strategy for maximum impact

**Immediate relief sequence:** File emergency TRO motion within 24-48 hours, obtain contempt show cause order, and request expedited Family Law Motions Calendar hearing. Simultaneously demand insurance reinstatement and asset freeze pending full hearing.

**Parallel federal action:** File ERISA Section 502(a) claim in federal court for benefit restoration and fiduciary breach. Federal jurisdiction provides additional pressure and may prevent state court forum shopping by defendants.

**Corporate law claims:** Pursue breach of fiduciary duty action against Brightwell individually and through derivative action against Mud Monkeys Inc. Seek receiver appointment if necessary to protect corporate assets including insurance benefits.

**Documentation requirements:** Secure all corporate records, insurance communications, and medical records demonstrating Miller's condition when coverage was cancelled. The "life support" timing creates powerful equitable arguments for courts.

## Conclusion

**Multiple legal theories converge to provide immediate and long-term relief options.** The contempt route offers fastest emergency relief with mandatory attorney fees, while ERISA claims provide federal court leverage. Corporate fiduciary duty violations strengthen damages claims, and committed intimate relationship status ensures property rights. **The combination of dissolution proceedings, corporate partnership, and admitted bad faith conduct creates an exceptionally strong legal position** for comprehensive relief without requiring escalation to more adversarial proceedings.
