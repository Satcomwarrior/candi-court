## TWO SEPARATE CASES CLARIFICATION

**YOUR TPO CASE:** The case you filed
**HER TPO CASE:** The case she filed and was awarded

These are separate legal proceedings. The financial evidence applies to:
1. Your original CIR case (if still active)
2. Any civil lawsuit you might file
3. Potential criminal referrals

## CONSERVATIVE FINANCIAL POSITION

**ONLY VERIFIED BANK DATA:** $123,621.19 (Account 3621082978)

**ADDITIONAL VERIFIABLE (if you have documentation):**
- Business account statements (438 files) - amounts TBD by actual review
- PayPal 2025 activity (if documented)
- Housing payments (if you have receipts/documentation)
- Property improvements (if you have receipts)

## HONEST LEGAL STRATEGY

**What we can PROVE with bank records:**
- $123,621 in documented financial activity
- Business-to-personal account transfers
- Joint financial management
- Ongoing financial relationship through 2024

**What we need MORE documentation for:**
- Housing payment contributions (need receipts/checks)
- Property improvement costs (need receipts)
- Business account theft amounts (need to analyze 438 statements)

## CORRECTED APPROACH

1. **Use ONLY the $123,621 verified from your bank analysis**
2. **Add documented amounts from the 438 business statements (when reviewed)**
3. **Include only provable housing/property expenses with receipts**
4. **NO estimates or projections - only actual documented amounts**

This keeps everything honest, accurate, and legally defensible.
