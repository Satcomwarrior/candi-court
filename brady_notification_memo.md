## III. DOCUMENTED CREDIBILITY PROBLEMS

### A. Category I: Perjury Regarding Physical Evidence

#### False Statement Under Oath:
*"I do not own, possess, or use any Android devices or tablets."*  
**Filed**: [Date] in sworn declaration, Snohomish County Superior Court

#### Contradictory Evidence:
- **Photographic Evidence**: Clear photographs showing Ms. Brightwell holding and using Samsung Tab SM-X200 Android tablet
- **Digital Forensics**: Google account logs showing extensive access from Samsung Tab SM-X200
- **Technical Verification**: Device authentication records confirming ownership and use

#### Legal Significance:
Device ownership was material to determining how unauthorized computer access occurred, making this perjury in the second degree under RCW 9A.72.040.

### B. Category II: False Statements Regarding Communication Patterns

#### False Statement Under Oath:
*"I am the victim of one-sided harassment and unwanted communication."*  
**Context**: Multiple filings portraying herself as passive victim

#### Contradictory Evidence:
- **Call Logs**: 87+ minutes of mutual phone conversations over 2-day period (August 5-6, 2025)
- **Text Evidence**: Active initiation and participation in lengthy text conversations
- **Audio Records**: Willing participation in extended discussions

#### Legal Significance:
This false victim narrative affects the fundamental nature of domestic violence and harassment charges, making witness unreliable on central elements.

### C. Category III: Denial of Computer Crimes

#### False Statement Under Oath:
*"I have never accessed his accounts without permission or authorization."*

#### Contradictory Evidence:
- **IP Address Logs**: Unauthorized access from her residence (73.140.204.197) during victim's incarceration
- **Timeline Evidence**: Access occurred when victim was physically incapacitated in jail/hospital
- **Written Admissions**: Text messages where she admits unauthorized access: *"Yes i did just disrespect you by logging into to your Chaturbate account..."*

#### Legal Significance:
This denial under oath of computer trespass (RCW 9A.90.040) demonstrates willingness to lie about criminal conduct, directly affecting credibility in any computer crime prosecution.

### D. Category IV: Evidence Tampering

#### False Statement Under Oath:
*"I have provided complete and unaltered communication records."*

#### Contradictory Evidence:
- **Deletion Records**: WhatsApp screenshots showing "This message was deleted" notifications
- **Selective Submission**: Comparison showing systematic deletion of her messages while preserving only harmful content
- **Metadata Analysis**: Technical evidence proving systematic evidence tampering

#### Legal Significance:
Evidence tampering in pending legal proceedings demonstrates consciousness of guilt and willingness to obstruct justice, affecting credibility in any proceeding involving evidence analysis.

### E. Category V: False Statements About Legal Representation

#### False Statement Under Oath:
*"I have authorized and approved all filings made by my counsel."*

#### Contradictory Evidence:
- **Email Records**: August 7, 2025 email demanding immediate retraction of attorney filings
- **Lack of Consent**: Statement that attorney filed materials without her knowledge
- **Timeline Evidence**: Retaliatory filing pattern suggesting unauthorized conduct

#### Legal Significance:
This creates question of either witness perjury or attorney misconduct, affecting reliability of any testimony about legal proceedings or attorney-client communications.
