## Unauthorized Use of Mudd Monkies Inc. Resale Certificate by Candi Lynn Brightwell

### Summary of Allegations

Candi Lynn Brightwell has been using the Mudd Monkies Inc. resale certificate to purchase tools, materials, security cameras, and an air purifier for her own personal use without the permission or authorization of William Orley Miller Jr. or Mudd Monkies Inc. This conduct constitutes unauthorized use of company resources and may be actionable under both civil and criminal statutes, including conversion, misappropriation of corporate assets, and financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult.

### Legal Relevance and Supporting Facts

- **Resale Certificate Restrictions:** The Mudd Monkies Inc. reseller permit is issued for the exclusive purpose of making wholesale purchases for business use. Use of the certificate for personal purchases is strictly prohibited and may result in revocation of the permit and additional penalties[^2_1].
- **Pattern of Misconduct:** Prior filings and declarations in Snohomish County Superior Court detail a consistent pattern of Candi Lynn Brightwell converting business assets for personal use, interfering with business operations, and denying access to business property[^2_2][^2_3][^2_4].
- **Specific Incidents:** The unauthorized acquisition of security cameras and an air purifier, along with other tools and materials, using the business’s resale certificate, is a direct violation of both business policy and court orders restraining the transfer or misuse of community and business property[^2_2][^2_4].


### Draft Language for Court Filings

#### 1. Supplemental Declaration in Support of Motions

> I, William Orley Miller Jr., declare under penalty of perjury that Candi Lynn Brightwell has used the Mudd Monkies Inc. resale certificate to purchase tools, materials, security cameras, and an air purifier for her own use and benefit, without my consent or the authorization of Mudd Monkies Inc. These actions were not for the benefit of the business and constitute unauthorized conversion of business resources. I request that the Court order a full accounting of all purchases made using the resale certificate and order the immediate return or reimbursement for any items not used for legitimate business purposes.

#### 2. Proposed Relief to Request

- Order a forensic accounting of all purchases made using the Mudd Monkies Inc. resale certificate since [insert relevant date].
- Immediate return of all tools, materials, security cameras, and air purifier purchased for personal use.
- Injunctive relief prohibiting further use of the resale certificate by Candi Lynn Brightwell.
- Monetary damages for the value of items converted and any resulting business losses.
- Sanctions for violation of court orders and misuse of business assets.


### Table: Summary of Misuse

| Item Purchased | Method Used | Intended Use | Actual Use | Relief Sought |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Tools \& Materials | Mudd Monkies Resale Cert. | Business | Personal | Return or reimbursement |
| Security Cameras | Mudd Monkies Resale Cert. | Business Security | Personal/home use | Return or reimbursement |
| Air Purifier | Mudd Monkies Resale Cert. | Business/Shop | Personal/home use | Return or reimbursement |

### Legal and Procedural Notes

- The court has already issued orders restraining both parties from transferring, encumbering, or disposing of community and business property, and specifically restraining the respondent from using Mudd Monkies Inc. business materials or equipment[^2_4].
- The misuse of the resale certificate for personal gain may also violate Washington State Department of Revenue rules, exposing the business to audit risk and penalties[^2_1].
- All evidence of these unauthorized purchases should be compiled and submitted as exhibits, including receipts, transaction records, and any correspondence regarding these purchases.


### Next Steps

- Include these facts and requests in all pending motions for contempt, asset protection, and business tort claims.
- Present this information to your attorney for review and inclusion in all relevant court filings.
- Request that the court order the preservation and production of all records related to the use of the resale certificate and the disposition of all items purchased.

This approach aligns with successful legal strategies in Snohomish County and ensures compliance with both court orders and local procedural requirements[^2_2][^2_3][^2_4].

## Clarification of Candi Lynn Brightwell’s Lack of Corporate Authority

### Key Facts

- **Candi Lynn Brightwell was never a formal officer or employee** of Mudd Monkies Inc. She was not appointed in writing as a Vice President, Manager, or officer, nor was she ever issued any formal employment contract or corporate authority.
- Her involvement was limited to informal administrative assistance. There was a period of discussion about her taking a more formal role, but this was never executed in writing or through any corporate resolution.
- **She was formally relieved of any administrative or office duties** around August 2024. After this point, she had no authorization to act on behalf of the company in any capacity.
- Despite lacking authority, she continued to use company resources, including the business’s resale certificate, assets, and financial accounts, for personal benefit. Many of these violations occurred after her removal from any administrative role.


### Specifics on Company Assets and Accounts

- **Debit Card Access:** Candi Lynn Brightwell was issued a debit card connected to a QuickBooks business account and possibly to the business bank account. This access was revoked around August 2024.
- **No Officer or Employee Status:** At no point was she listed as an officer, director, or employee in company records or filings. There are no board minutes, employment agreements, or resolutions granting her any such authority.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** After her removal, she continued to:
    - Use the company’s resale certificate to make personal purchases.
    - Access or attempt to access business accounts and assets.
    - Fail to file required business reports, harming the company’s standing and operations.


### Legal and Procedural Implications

- **Conversion and Misappropriation:** Any use of company assets, certificates, or accounts by Candi Lynn Brightwell after her removal constitutes unauthorized conversion and misappropriation.
- **No Actual or Apparent Authority:** Because she was never formally appointed and was explicitly removed from any company role, she had neither actual nor apparent authority to act for Mudd Monkies Inc.
- **Corporate Records and Evidence:** The absence of any formal appointment, combined with the timing of her removal and subsequent unauthorized actions, should be clearly stated in all declarations and motions.


### Draft Language for Court Filings

> I, William Orley Miller Jr., declare under penalty of perjury that Candi Lynn Brightwell was never a formal officer, director, or employee of Mudd Monkies Inc. Her involvement was limited to informal administrative assistance, and she was formally relieved of all such duties in or around August 2024. After her removal, she had no authority to act on behalf of the company. Despite this, she continued to use company assets, accounts, and certificates without permission, in violation of company policy and court orders. I request that the Court take judicial notice of her lack of authority and order a full accounting and restitution for all unauthorized actions taken after her removal.

### Table: Timeline of Candi Lynn Brightwell’s Involvement

| Period | Role/Status | Authority Level | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Pre-August 2024 | Informal admin help | None (informal only) | No written authority, no officer/employee status |
| August 2024 | Formally relieved of all duties | None | Debit card and account access revoked |
| Post-August 2024 | No role, no authority | None | Unauthorized use of assets/certificates occurred |

### Next Steps for Legal Filings

- Include a sworn statement clarifying her lack of authority and the timing of her removal in all court declarations.
- Attach supporting evidence of her lack of officer/employee status and the revocation of her account access.
- Request a forensic accounting and restitution for all unauthorized transactions and use of company assets after her removal.
- Emphasize in all motions that any actions taken by Candi Lynn Brightwell after August 2024 were without any legal or corporate authority.

This approach will clarify the corporate structure and support claims for conversion, misappropriation, and violation of court orders regarding company property and assets[^3_1][^3_2][^3_3].

## Impact of Candi Lynn Brightwell’s Assumed VP or Managerial Role on Company Liability

### 1. Corporate Liability for Acts of Apparent Officers or Managers

- **Agency and Authority:** If a person assumes a VP or managerial role—whether formally appointed or not—and acts with apparent authority, the company can be held liable for actions taken within the scope of that apparent role. Courts often treat managers and officers as agents of the corporation; their actions, if perceived as authorized by third parties, can bind the company under the doctrine of vicarious liability[^4_1].
- **Scope of Employment:** If Candi’s actions, while acting as a de facto manager or VP, were reasonably within the scope of what such a role would entail (e.g., making purchases, managing assets), the company may be liable for her conduct, even if she was not formally appointed[^4_2][^4_1].


### 2. Limits and Exceptions to Company Liability

- **Unauthorized or Ultra Vires Acts:** If Candi acted outside the scope of her actual or apparent authority—such as using company assets for personal gain without any board approval or contrary to explicit company policy—the company may argue those acts were “ultra vires” (beyond her authority). In such cases, the company can potentially avoid liability, but only if it can show third parties were aware of her lack of authority[^4_3][^4_4].
- **Notice to Third Parties:** If suppliers or others knew or should have known she was not an officer, the company’s liability may be limited. However, if she was allowed to act publicly as a VP or manager, the company may still be bound by her actions[^4_1].


### 3. Personal Liability of the Assumed Manager

- **Personal Accountability:** If Candi committed wrongful acts (such as conversion, fraud, or breach of fiduciary duty), she can be personally liable, especially if she was never formally authorized or if she knowingly acted against the company’s interests[^4_5][^4_2][^4_4].
- **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** In rare circumstances, if she used her position to commit fraud or misuse the company as an alter ego for personal purposes, courts could hold both her and the company liable by “piercing the corporate veil”[^4_5][^4_6].


### 4. Washington State Specifics

- **Statutory Liability:** Washington law can impose liability on officers, vice principals, and even agents for certain statutory violations (e.g., unpaid wages), regardless of formal appointment[^4_7][^4_8].
- **Fiduciary Duties:** Even informal managers owe duties of loyalty and care to the company. Breaches can result in both company and personal liability, depending on the harm caused[^4_2][^4_4].


### 5. Table: Company vs. Personal Liability for Assumed Managerial Acts

| Scenario | Company Liability | Candi’s Personal Liability | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Acts within apparent authority | Yes | Possibly | Company liable if third parties reasonably relied on her role[^4_1] |
| Acts outside authority (ultra vires) | Possibly | Yes | Company may avoid liability if third parties knew of limits[^4_3][^4_4] |
| Fraud, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty | No (usually) | Yes | Personal liability for wrongful acts, company may be liable if benefited[^4_5][^4_2][^4_4] |
| Statutory violations (e.g., unpaid wages) | Yes | Yes | Both can be liable under Washington law[^4_7][^4_8] |

### 6. Practical Implications

- The company should clearly document who holds officer/managerial roles and communicate this to third parties.
- Allowing someone to act as a VP or manager without formal appointment or oversight increases the risk that the company will be held liable for their actions.
- If wrongful acts occurred after her removal and the company took steps to notify relevant parties, this can help limit liability.

**In summary:** Candi’s assumption of a VP or managerial role—especially if not formally documented but apparent to outsiders—can expose Mudd Monkies Inc. to liability for her actions within the scope of that role. However, for unauthorized, fraudulent, or ultra vires acts, she can be held personally liable, and the company’s liability may be limited if it can show her lack of authority was clear to third parties[^4_5][^4_2][^4_4][^4_1][^4_8].

## Is Using the Resale Certificate for Personal Purchases "Piercing the Corporate Veil"?

### Understanding Piercing the Corporate Veil

*Piercing the corporate veil* is a legal doctrine that allows courts to disregard the separation between a corporation and its owners or agents, holding individuals personally liable for corporate debts or misconduct. Courts are generally reluctant to do this and require evidence that the corporate form was abused to perpetrate fraud, injustice, or evade legal duties[^5_1][^5_2][^5_3].

### Misuse of a Resale Certificate

A resale certificate is strictly for business purchases intended for resale or legitimate business use. Using it for personal purchases—such as tools, security cameras, or air purifiers for private benefit—constitutes misuse and may be considered an abuse of the corporate form[^5_4][^5_5].

### Does This Constitute Piercing the Veil?

- **Commingling of Assets:** If a person uses corporate privileges (like a resale certificate) for personal gain, it is evidence of commingling personal and business assets, which is a key factor courts consider when deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil[^5_1][^5_6][^5_7].
- **Fraud or Injustice:** Courts may pierce the veil if the corporation is used to commit fraud, perpetrate a wrong, or evade legal obligations. Using a resale certificate for personal purchases can be seen as using the corporate entity to avoid paying sales tax personally, which may rise to the level of fraud or unjust conduct[^5_6][^5_3].
- **Washington State Law:** In Washington, piercing the corporate veil requires proof that the corporate form was intentionally used to violate or evade a duty, and that disregarding the corporate entity is necessary to prevent unjust loss. The misuse of a resale certificate for personal benefit could meet these criteria if it results in harm to creditors, the company, or the state[^5_3].


### Practical Implications

- **Personal Liability:** If a court finds that the misuse of the resale certificate was part of a broader pattern of abusing the corporate form (e.g., using company funds for personal expenses, failing to observe corporate formalities), it may hold the individual personally liable for resulting debts, taxes, or damages[^5_1][^5_2][^5_6].
- **Not Automatic:** Simply using the resale certificate for personal purchases does not automatically result in piercing the corporate veil, but it is strong evidence supporting such a claim, especially if combined with other factors like lack of corporate records, undercapitalization, or failure to separate personal and corporate affairs[^5_1][^5_7][^5_3].


### Table: Factors Supporting Veil Piercing

| Factor | Relevance to Resale Certificate Misuse |
| :-- | :-- |
| Commingling of funds/assets | Yes—personal use of business certificate |
| Fraud or evasion of legal duty | Yes—avoiding sales tax, violating business purpose |
| Lack of corporate formalities | Possible—if no records or oversight |
| Harm to creditors or unjust loss | Yes—if company or third parties are harmed |

### Conclusion

**Using a company’s resale certificate for personal purchases is a significant indicator of abusing the corporate form and can support a claim to pierce the corporate veil, especially if part of a broader pattern of misconduct.** However, courts will look at the totality of circumstances before imposing personal liability[^5_1][^5_6][^5_3].

## Legal Violations for Unauthorized Use of Resale Certificate and Blocking Business Operations

### 1. **Improper Use of Resale Certificate (Washington Law)**

- **Statutory Violation**: Using a resale certificate for personal purchases, or after losing authority (such as after dissolution or removal from the company), is a violation of Washington law.
- **Penalties**: Washington imposes a penalty of 50% of the tax due on any improperly purchased item or service, in addition to all other taxes, penalties, and interest. This applies even if there was no intent to evade tax[^6_1][^6_2][^6_3].
- **Civil and Potential Criminal Exposure**: Repeated or egregious misuse may also expose the individual to claims of fraud or tax evasion, especially if the misuse was willful and for personal gain.


### 2. **Conversion and Misappropriation of Business Assets**

- **Conversion**: Using company resources (including the resale certificate) for personal benefit, especially after removal from any company role, constitutes conversion—an unauthorized exercise of control over company property.
- **Misappropriation**: Continued use of business assets, funds, or privileges after the dissolution or removal from authority is actionable as misappropriation and may support civil claims for damages and restitution.


### 3. **Intentional Interference with Business Expectancy**

- **Blocking Access**: Preventing William from accessing the business, its premises, or its operations can constitute intentional interference with business expectancy. This is actionable if it results in financial harm or loss of business opportunities[^6_4].
- **Elements**: To prevail, William must show a valid business expectancy, Candi’s knowledge of it, intentional interference, improper means or motive, and resulting damages.


### 4. **Breach of Fiduciary Duty (if any existed)**

- If Candi held any position of trust (even informally), using business privileges for personal gain and obstructing business operations could be a breach of fiduciary duty, exposing her to personal liability.


### 5. **Obstruction of Business and Potential Criminal Conduct**

- **Obstruction**: Willfully impeding business operations or access may constitute obstruction of business, which can carry civil and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties if it rises to the level of fraud or causes significant harm[^6_5].
- **Fraudulent Conduct**: If Candi’s actions were intended to defraud William or the company, criminal fraud statutes may also apply.


### 6. **Violation of Court Orders**

- If there are existing court orders restraining transfer, use, or interference with business assets, violating these orders can result in contempt proceedings and additional sanctions.


## Table: Violations and Legal Consequences

| Violation | Description | Legal Consequence | Statute/Authority |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Improper use of resale certificate | Using certificate for personal purchases after authority revoked | 50% penalty + taxes/interest | RCW 82.32.291[^6_2][^6_3] |
| Conversion/Misappropriation | Unauthorized use of business assets/certificates | Civil damages, restitution | Common law, tort |
| Intentional interference with business | Blocking access, preventing business operations | Civil damages | Tort law[^6_4] |
| Breach of fiduciary duty | Self-dealing, harming company interests (if fiduciary duty existed) | Personal liability | Corporate law |
| Obstruction of business | Willful interference with business activities | Civil/criminal penalties | State/local law[^6_5] |
| Violation of court orders | Disregarding court-ordered restraints on assets/business | Contempt, sanctions | Civil procedure |

### **Key Actions for William**

- Seek forensic accounting of all purchases made with the resale certificate after Candi’s removal.
- Request court orders for restitution, return of property, and production of all records.
- Pursue civil claims for conversion, interference, and any damages.
- Consider contempt proceedings if court orders have been violated.

These violations are actionable under Washington law and provide strong grounds for both civil and, potentially, criminal remedies[^6_1][^6_2][^6_3][^6_4].

## Elements of Intentional Interference with Business Expectancy

**(Applicable to Mudd Monkies Inc., a Washington C Corporation)**

To successfully pursue a claim for intentional interference with business expectancy under Washington law, William (and/or Mudd Monkies Inc.) must establish the following elements:

### 1. **Valid Business Expectancy**

- Mudd Monkies Inc. must have a reasonable expectation of continuing or future business relationships or economic advantage (such as ongoing sales, contracts, or customer relationships).
- As a C corporation, these expectancies may include established vendor relationships, client contracts, or ongoing business operations.


### 2. **Knowledge by Candi Lynn Brightwell**

- Candi must have known about the existence of these business expectancies.
- Evidence may include her prior administrative involvement, access to business records, and communications showing awareness of business operations and relationships.


### 3. **Intentional Interference**

- Candi must have intentionally acted to interfere with these business expectancies.
- Examples include:
    - Blocking William’s access to the business premises or records.
    - Using the resale certificate to make unauthorized personal purchases, thereby exposing the business to penalties and disrupting operations.
    - Preventing the company from fulfilling orders or maintaining customer relationships.


### 4. **Improper Means or Motive**

- The interference must have been wrongful by some measure beyond mere competition, such as:
    - Use of deception, fraud, or misrepresentation.
    - Violation of court orders or company policies.
    - Misuse of corporate assets after removal from any position of authority.
- In this case, Candi’s actions after her removal (e.g., using the resale certificate, blocking business operations) would likely qualify as improper means.


### 5. **Resulting Damages**

- The interference must have caused actual harm to Mudd Monkies Inc. or William, such as:
    - Lost profits or business opportunities.
    - Penalties or liabilities resulting from improper use of the resale certificate.
    - Costs incurred to restore business operations or recover assets.


## Table: Application of Elements to Mudd Monkies Inc.

| Element | Evidence/Fact Pattern in This Case |
| :-- | :-- |
| Valid Business Expectancy | Ongoing business operations, customer/vendor relationships |
| Candi’s Knowledge | Prior admin role, access to records, direct involvement |
| Intentional Interference | Blocking access, misuse of accounts, unauthorized purchases |
| Improper Means or Motive | After removal, in violation of policy and court orders |
| Resulting Damages | Lost income, business disruption, penalties, restoration costs |

## Notes on C Corporation Status

- **Separate Legal Entity:** As a C corp, Mudd Monkies Inc. is a distinct legal entity, and all claims for interference or damages are asserted on behalf of the corporation.
- **Officer/Director Duties:** Because Candi was never a formal officer or employee, her actions are clearly outside the scope of any corporate authority, strengthening the claim of improper interference.
- **Corporate Records:** Maintaining clear records of her lack of formal role and the timing of her removal will be critical to show both lack of authority and knowledge of business expectancies.


## Recommended Legal Steps

- Document all business relationships and opportunities disrupted by Candi’s actions.
- Gather evidence of her knowledge and intent (emails, messages, prior access).
- Detail all improper actions and resulting damages in court filings.
- Assert the claim for intentional interference with business expectancy as a cause of action in any civil suit or motion for relief.

This approach aligns with Washington law and the procedural requirements for C corporations in Snohomish County.

## Fiduciary Duties in the Context of Mudd Monkies Inc.

### What Are Fiduciary Duties?

**Fiduciary duties** are legal and ethical obligations owed by certain individuals to act in the best interests of another party—in this case, the company. In a business context, these duties most commonly apply to officers, directors, and sometimes key employees or agents who have substantial control or influence over company affairs.

#### Core Fiduciary Duties

- **Duty of Loyalty:** Obligation to act honestly and in good faith for the benefit of the company, avoiding personal gain at the company’s expense.
- **Duty of Care:** Obligation to act with the care that a reasonably prudent person would take in similar circumstances, including prudent management of company assets and records.
- **Duty of Confidentiality:** Obligation to keep company information private and not use it for personal benefit.
- **Duty to Account:** Obligation to accurately account for all company funds, property, and transactions.


### Application to Candi Lynn Brightwell’s Role

Even if Candi was not a formal officer or employee, her actions and involvement may have created **de facto fiduciary duties** to Mudd Monkies Inc., especially if she:

- Regularly handled or controlled company financial documents.
- Had access to and managed business assets, such as tools and inventory stored in the shop.
- Represented herself as “administration” on job filings, proceedings, or communications.
- Was entrusted with sensitive business information or decision-making authority, formally or informally.
- Participated in or witnessed business operations, including prefabrication and project management on the property.

**Washington law recognizes that persons who assume significant control or responsibility over company affairs—even without formal titles—may be held to fiduciary standards if their conduct and the company’s reliance create such a relationship.**

### Evidence of Fiduciary Relationship in Your Case

Based on your description:

- Candi had **possession of all financial documents** and access to company records.
- She **witnessed and participated in business operations** on the property, including prefabrication and job management.
- She **represented herself as administration** in filings and job-related proceedings.
- She had **custody of company assets** (tools, materials) and was involved in after-hours activities in the shop.

These facts strongly support the existence of a fiduciary relationship, even absent formal appointment. Her duties would have included safeguarding company property, maintaining confidentiality, and acting in the company’s best interests.

### Breach of Fiduciary Duty

If Candi:

- Used company assets or information for personal gain,
- Failed to return financial documents or tools,
- Blocked access to company property or records,
- Misrepresented her authority or failed to act in the company’s best interests,

then she may have **breached her fiduciary duties** to Mudd Monkies Inc. This can form the basis for civil claims seeking damages, restitution, or other remedies.

### Table: Fiduciary Duties and Candi’s Involvement

| Fiduciary Duty | How It Applies to Candi’s Role | Potential Breach Examples |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Duty of Loyalty | Trusted with business assets, records | Personal use of assets, acting against company |
| Duty of Care | Managed documents, participated in ops | Negligence with records, failing to safeguard |
| Duty of Confidentiality | Access to sensitive info, filings | Disclosing or misusing company information |
| Duty to Account | Held financial documents | Failing to return or account for company property |

### Legal Implications

- **De facto fiduciary status**: Courts look at substance over form; if she acted as a key administrator or agent, she can be held to these duties.
- **Remedies**: The company can seek damages, return of property, and other relief for breach of fiduciary duty.
- **Supporting Evidence**: Her possession of documents, involvement in operations, and self-identification as administration all support these claims.

**In summary:** Even without a formal title, Candi’s administrative role, access to company property, and involvement in business operations likely imposed fiduciary duties. Her actions regarding company assets and records are subject to these legal standards, and any misuse or obstruction can be pursued as a breach of fiduciary duty under Washington law.

## Impact of Candi Lynn Brightwell’s Actions on William Miller’s Case

### Does Candi’s Role and Conduct Hurt or Help William Miller’s Case?

**Candi Lynn Brightwell’s actions and her assumption of an administrative role—despite lacking formal authority—generally strengthen the case against her on behalf of William Miller and Mudd Monkies Inc.** Here’s why:

### How Her Actions Help the Case

- **Evidence of Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** Even without a formal title, Candi’s control over financial documents, business assets, and her self-identification as “administration” create a de facto fiduciary relationship. Her misuse of company assets and obstruction of business operations can be pursued as breaches of these duties, supporting claims for damages and restitution.
- **Unauthorized Use of Corporate Privileges:** Her use of the resale certificate and company accounts for personal gain after her removal demonstrates conversion, misappropriation, and potentially fraud. This is strong evidence of wrongful conduct.
- **Violation After Revocation of Authority:** The fact that she continued these actions after being formally relieved of any duties eliminates any defense of implied or apparent authority, making her personally liable for unauthorized transactions and interference.
- **Intentional Interference with Business Expectancy:** Her knowledge of business operations, combined with actions that blocked William’s access and harmed business prospects, satisfies the elements for this tort under Washington law.
- **Strengthens Claims for Court Relief:** The documented pattern of misconduct, especially in violation of court orders or after her removal, provides a solid factual basis for contempt motions, injunctive relief, and demands for accounting and restitution.


### Are There Any Risks or Downsides?

- **Potential Company Liability (Limited):** If third parties reasonably believed Candi had authority (because she was allowed to act as administration), there is a slight risk the company could be held liable for her actions. However, since she was never formally appointed and was explicitly removed, this risk is minimal—especially if William and the company can show they notified relevant parties and revoked her access.
- **Importance of Documentation:** The case is strongest if William and Mudd Monkies Inc. maintain clear records of her lack of formal appointment, the timing of her removal, and all steps taken to prevent her further involvement.


### Table: Effect on William Miller’s Case

| Factor | Effect on Case for William Miller |
| :-- | :-- |
| Candi’s informal admin role | Helps—shows trust and access, supporting fiduciary duty arguments |
| Use of company assets after removal | Helps—clear evidence of conversion/misappropriation |
| Blocking business operations | Helps—supports intentional interference and damages claims |
| No formal officer/employee status | Helps—limits company liability, increases her personal liability |
| Documentation of removal and lack of authority | Helps—rebuts any claim of apparent authority |

### Conclusion

**Candi’s actions—especially her continued use of business assets, certificates, and authority after removal—substantially help William Miller’s case against her.** They provide clear grounds for civil claims (conversion, misappropriation, breach of fiduciary duty, interference) and support requests for court-ordered relief. The more thoroughly these facts are documented, the stronger the case will be.

## Can the Court Order Counseling If Requested in Snohomish County?

### Family Law and Counseling Orders

In Washington State, including Snohomish County, courts have the authority to order parties to attend counseling or therapy as part of family law proceedings—such as divorce, legal separation, or custody disputes—if it is deemed in the best interests of the parties or any children involved.

#### When Can Counseling Be Ordered?

- **If a Party Requests Counseling:** The court may consider a request for counseling and has the discretion to order parties to participate, especially if it finds that counseling could help resolve issues, improve communication, or serve the welfare of children.
- **Parenting and Custody Cases:** Courts frequently order family or co-parenting counseling when there are disputes over parenting plans, communication, or allegations of conflict affecting children.
- **Marital Counseling:** While less common in no-fault divorce states like Washington, a judge can technically order marriage or couples counseling if requested and if the court believes it may facilitate resolution[^12_1].


#### Statutory Authority

- **RCW 26.09.030** gives courts broad discretion in family law cases to make orders that serve the best interests of the parties and children, which can include counseling or therapy[^12_1].
- **Domestic Violence or Protection Order Cases:** If there are allegations of abuse, courts may order counseling or treatment as part of a protection order or as a condition for modifying contact or visitation.


#### Limitations

- **Mutual Agreement:** Courts are more likely to order counseling if both parties agree or if there is a clear benefit to the children.
- **Safety Concerns:** If there are concerns about domestic violence or safety, the court may be reluctant to order joint counseling and may instead order individual counseling or other remedies[^12_1].
- **Enforcement:** The court can enforce counseling orders and may impose sanctions for non-compliance.


### Practical Steps

- **Request in Motion:** If you want counseling to be ordered, include a specific request in your motion or petition, explaining why counseling would be beneficial.
- **Types of Counseling:** Specify the type (family, co-parenting, individual, substance abuse, etc.) and whether you seek joint or separate sessions.
- **Supporting Evidence:** Provide evidence or declarations supporting the need for counseling, especially if it relates to the best interests of children or resolving disputes.


### Table: When Courts May Order Counseling

| Type of Case | Can Court Order Counseling? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Divorce/Separation | Yes | Especially if requested and in best interests of parties |
| Child Custody/Parenting | Yes | Often ordered for co-parenting or communication issues |
| Domestic Violence/Protection | Yes (with caution) | May order individual, less likely to order joint counseling |
| By Mutual Agreement | Yes | Court likely to approve if both parties agree |

### Conclusion

**If you request counseling in your family law case, the court has the authority to order it, especially if it finds that counseling will benefit the parties or any children involved.** The request should be clearly stated in your motion, and supporting reasons or evidence will strengthen your position[^12_1]. The court’s primary concern is always the welfare of the parties and any children, and it will tailor orders accordingly.

## Requesting Court-Ordered Counseling Without Children or Custody Issues

Even though you and Candi Lynn Brightwell do not share biological children and there are no custody rights at issue, you can still ask the court to order counseling or mediation if you believe it could help resolve your disputes or give your relationship a genuine chance at reconciliation.

### Key Considerations

- **No Children or Custody:** The absence of shared children or custody rights means the court’s primary concern will not be child welfare, but rather the interests and well-being of the parties involved.
- **Warrant and Legal Proceedings:** If there is an active warrant or ongoing legal proceedings (such as protection orders or contempt motions), the court’s willingness to order joint counseling may depend on the nature of those proceedings and any safety concerns.
- **Desire for Reconciliation:** Courts can consider a party’s genuine wish to attempt reconciliation or improve communication, especially if you clearly articulate this in your filings.


### How to Request Counseling

- **Include a Specific Request:** In your motion or declaration, state your desire to pursue counseling or mediation with Candi, explaining your reasons and what you hope to achieve.
- **Acknowledge the Legal Context:** If there are protection orders, warrants, or allegations of harm, acknowledge these issues and propose counseling only if it is safe and appropriate.
- **Type of Counseling:** Specify whether you seek couples counseling, mediation, or another form of facilitated communication.


### What the Court May Consider

| Factor | Court’s Likely Response |
| :-- | :-- |
| No children/custody | Focus on adult parties’ interests and safety |
| Active warrant/protection order | May limit or deny joint counseling for safety reasons |
| Mutual agreement to counseling | Increases likelihood court will order or permit it |
| Clear, good-faith request | Court may consider if it serves justice or reconciliation |

### Practical Steps

- **File a Motion or Declaration:** Clearly request counseling and explain your motivation.
- **Propose Safe Arrangements:** If there are safety concerns or legal restrictions, suggest alternatives (e.g., separate counseling, mediation via video, or with court-approved providers).
- **Be Open to Court’s Discretion:** The court has broad authority to fashion remedies that serve the interests of justice and the well-being of the parties, even when no children are involved.


### Sample Language for Your Declaration

> I acknowledge that there are no biological children or custody rights at issue in this matter. However, I have a sincere interest in attempting to resolve our disputes amicably and believe that counseling or mediation could provide an opportunity for reconciliation or at least mutual understanding. I respectfully request that the Court consider ordering or permitting such counseling, provided it is safe and appropriate under the circumstances.

**In summary:**
You can request court-ordered counseling even without shared children or custody issues. The court will weigh your request in light of any legal proceedings, safety concerns, and the overall interests of justice. Clearly state your intentions and reasons, and the court may grant your request if it finds it appropriate.

## Court-Ordered Counseling When One Party Objects

If you believe Candi Lynn Brightwell would not agree to counseling, the court’s approach will depend on the circumstances of your case and the nature of the legal proceedings.

### Key Points

- **Court Discretion:** In Washington, the court can order counseling or mediation if it finds that doing so may help resolve disputes or serve the interests of justice, even if one party objects. However, the court is more likely to order counseling when both parties are willing to participate.
- **No Mutual Agreement:** If Candi does not want counseling, the court may be reluctant to order joint sessions, especially if there are protection orders, a history of conflict, or safety concerns.
- **Alternative Approaches:** The court may suggest or order individual counseling, mediation, or other forms of dispute resolution that do not require both parties’ consent, particularly if it could help facilitate communication or settlement.
- **Best Interests and Safety:** The court’s primary consideration will be the safety and well-being of both parties. If there is any risk of harm or ongoing legal restrictions, the court may deny or limit requests for joint counseling.


### What You Can Do

- **Still Make the Request:** You can include a request for counseling or mediation in your filings, explaining your reasons and acknowledging that the other party may not wish to participate.
- **Propose Alternatives:** Suggest individual counseling or court-facilitated mediation as options, which the court may be more willing to order if one party objects to joint sessions.
- **Focus on Good Faith:** Demonstrating your willingness to resolve matters amicably can reflect positively on you, even if the court ultimately does not order counseling.


### Table: Court’s Likely Response Based on Party Willingness

| Both Parties Agree | Only One Party Wants Counseling | Neither Party Wants Counseling |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Likely to Order | Possible, but less likely | Unlikely to Order |

### Sample Language for Your Motion or Declaration

> I recognize that the other party may not wish to participate in counseling or mediation. Nevertheless, I am willing to engage in such efforts if the Court believes it would be beneficial. If joint counseling is not appropriate, I am open to individual counseling or other forms of dispute resolution as the Court may suggest.

**In summary:**
While the court can order counseling even if only one party requests it, such orders are less common when the other party objects—especially if there are legal or safety concerns. You may still request counseling or propose alternatives, but the court will ultimately decide based on the circumstances and the willingness of both parties to participate.

## Cost and Efficiency Benefits of Counseling or Mediation

Requesting counseling or mediation in your legal dispute can offer significant advantages, especially in terms of saving money and reducing court congestion.

### Financial Savings

- **Lower Legal Fees:** Mediation or counseling sessions typically cost much less than prolonged court litigation, which can involve multiple hearings, motions, and attorney hours.
- **Faster Resolution:** Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods often resolve issues more quickly, reducing the need for extended legal representation and associated costs.
- **Reduced Filing and Court Costs:** By settling disputes outside of court, parties can avoid many of the fees and expenses that come with formal court proceedings.


### Reduced Court Congestion

- **Eases Court Caseload:** Opting for mediation or counseling helps alleviate the burden on the court system, allowing judges to focus on cases that truly require judicial intervention.
- **Timelier Outcomes:** With fewer cases on the docket, those that do require court attention can be addressed more promptly, benefiting all parties involved.


### Additional Benefits

- **Greater Control:** Parties have more say in the outcome and process, rather than leaving decisions solely to a judge.
- **Confidentiality:** Mediation and counseling are private, whereas court proceedings are generally public record.
- **Preservation of Relationships:** Collaborative approaches can help maintain or improve communication, which is especially valuable if ongoing interaction is necessary.


### Table: Comparison of Legal Proceedings vs. Mediation/Counseling

| Factor | Court Litigation | Mediation/Counseling |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Cost | High | Lower |
| Time to Resolution | Often lengthy | Usually faster |
| Privacy | Public record | Confidential |
| Court Congestion | Adds to caseload | Reduces caseload |
| Control Over Outcome | Judge decides | Parties decide |

### Practical Considerations

- **Proposal in Filings:** You can highlight these cost and efficiency benefits in your motion or declaration when requesting counseling or mediation.
- **Court Receptiveness:** Courts often view ADR favorably, especially when it can resolve disputes efficiently and amicably.

**In summary:**
Requesting counseling or mediation is a practical step that can save both money and time, while also helping to keep the court system less congested. This approach demonstrates a good-faith effort to resolve disputes efficiently and may be well received by the court.

# How to Present Legal Requests for Counseling or Other Motions in Court

## 1. Format of the Request: Motion or Declaration

- **Motion:**
A formal written request asking the court to issue an order. For counseling or mediation, this would typically be a **Motion for Counseling or Mediation** or a related motion within your case.
- **Declaration:**
A sworn statement (written under penalty of perjury) supporting the motion. This explains your reasons for requesting counseling, the benefits you foresee, and any relevant background facts.
- **Combined Filing:**
Often, a motion is accompanied by a supporting declaration. The motion states the legal request, and the declaration provides the factual basis.


## 2. What to Include in the Motion

- **Title:** Clearly identify the motion (e.g., "Motion for Court-Ordered Counseling" or "Motion for Mediation").
- **Case Caption:** Include the court name, case number, and parties’ names.
- **Introduction:** Briefly state who you are and what you are requesting.
- **Legal Basis:** Cite any relevant statutes or court rules that allow the court to order counseling or mediation.
- **Facts and Reasons:** Explain why counseling is appropriate, including any benefits like reducing conflict, saving money, or improving communication.
- **Request for Relief:** Clearly specify what you want the court to order (e.g., joint counseling, individual counseling, mediation).
- **Signature and Date:** Sign and date the motion.


## 3. What to Include in the Declaration

- **Personal Statement:** Your full name and relationship to the case.
- **Background:** Briefly describe the situation and why counseling is needed.
- **Supporting Facts:** Detail your sincere interest in counseling, any attempts to communicate this to the other party, and any safety or legal concerns.
- **Conclusion:** Reiterate your request for the court’s consideration.
- **Signature and Date:** Sign and date under penalty of perjury.


## 4. Presentation to the Court vs. Presenting to the Other Party’s Lawyer

- **Filing with the Court:**
You must file the motion and declaration with the court clerk. This officially puts your request before the judge.
- **Serving the Other Party:**
After filing, you must **serve** (deliver) copies of the motion and declaration to the other party or their attorney. This ensures they have notice and an opportunity to respond.
- **Presenting to the Other Party’s Lawyer First:**
    - It is not required to present motions to the opposing lawyer before filing, but it is often good practice to **informally communicate** or attempt to resolve issues before involving the court.
    - If you want, you can send a copy of the motion to the opposing counsel before filing to encourage agreement or negotiation.
- **Court Hearing:**
The court may schedule a hearing to consider the motion, where both parties can present arguments.


## 5. Practical Steps to Take

1. **Draft the Motion and Declaration:** Use clear, concise language and include all necessary information.
2. **File with the Court Clerk:** Submit the documents to the Snohomish County Superior Court clerk.
3. **Serve the Other Party:** Deliver copies to Candi Lynn Brightwell or her attorney according to court rules.
4. **Attend Hearing (if scheduled):** Be prepared to explain your request and answer questions.
5. **Follow Court Orders:** If the court grants your motion, comply with any counseling or mediation requirements.

## 6. Summary Table: Motion Process Overview

| Step | Description | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Draft Motion \& Declaration | Prepare formal written request and supporting facts | Use court-approved format if available |
| File with Court | Submit documents to court clerk | Official start of court consideration |
| Serve Other Party | Provide copies to opposing party or attorney | Required for due process |
| Court Hearing | Attend if court schedules a hearing | Present your case, respond to questions |
| Court Order | Receive court’s decision on your motion | Comply with any orders issued |

**In summary:**
You should prepare a formal **motion** supported by a **declaration** and file these with the court. After filing, serve the other party or their lawyer. While it is not mandatory to present the motion to the other party’s lawyer before filing, doing so can sometimes facilitate resolution. The court will then consider your request and may hold a hearing before issuing an order.

## Relaying a Counseling Request Through Her Lawyer: Considerations

### Is It Permissible?

Yes, you are allowed to communicate your request for counseling (or any other settlement or procedural matter) through Candi Lynn Brightwell’s attorney. In fact, this is a common and professional approach in legal disputes, especially when both parties are represented or when there is tension or ongoing litigation.

### Potential Benefits

- **Professionalism:** Communicating through her lawyer keeps the process formal and reduces the risk of misunderstandings or emotional escalation.
- **Documentation:** Your request and any responses will be documented, which can be useful for the court record.
- **Facilitates Negotiation:** Lawyers can often help clarify, negotiate, or even agree to terms without requiring court intervention.
- **Avoids Direct Contact:** Especially important if there are protection orders or strained relations.


### Possible Issues or Limitations

- **No Guarantee of Agreement:** Her lawyer may simply relay your request to Candi, but cannot force her to agree. If she declines, you would still need to file a motion with the court if you want an order.
- **Delay:** Going through attorneys can sometimes slow down communication, depending on responsiveness.
- **Not Legally Binding:** An informal request or discussion through counsel does not create a court order. For enforceability, you must file a formal motion if agreement isn’t reached.
- **Attorney’s Role:** Her lawyer represents her interests and may advise her to decline or counter your request.


### When Issues Might Arise

- **Protection Orders or No-Contact Orders:** If there are court orders restricting contact, communicating through her lawyer is the appropriate (and sometimes only) channel.
- **Urgency:** If time is of the essence (e.g., imminent hearings or deadlines), direct filing with the court may be more efficient.


### Best Practices

- **Be Clear and Respectful:** Clearly state your request and your reasons. Keep the tone professional and focused on resolution.
- **Put It in Writing:** Email or a formal letter is preferred for clarity and record-keeping.
- **Allow Reasonable Time for Response:** Give her lawyer a reasonable deadline to reply before proceeding to court.
- **Prepare to File a Motion:** If agreement cannot be reached, be ready to file your request formally with the court.


### Sample Communication Outline

> Dear [Her Lawyer’s Name],
>
> I am writing to request that the parties consider participating in [counseling/mediation/other ADR]. I believe this could help resolve outstanding issues more efficiently and cost-effectively. Please let me know if your client is willing to discuss or participate in this process.
>
> If I do not hear back by [date], I may proceed to file a formal motion with the court.

**In summary:**
Relaying your request through her lawyer is appropriate and often beneficial. It does not present any legal issues, provided you follow proper channels and remain professional. If agreement is not reached, you retain the right to formally request court intervention.

---

## Is It Coercion or Illegal to Refuse Mediation or Counseling and Demand Everything?

### Refusing Mediation or Counseling

- **Not Illegal:** You are not legally required to continue mediation or counseling if the other party is unwilling to participate. Courts encourage—but do not force—parties to resolve disputes through alternative dispute resolution (ADR) like mediation or counseling. If one party is unwilling, you are free to pursue your legal claims through the court process.
- **No Coercion:** Deciding not to mediate or attempt reconciliation because the other party refuses counseling is not considered coercion. Coercion involves using threats, force, or unlawful pressure to make someone do something against their will. Simply choosing to litigate rather than mediate is a legal right, not coercion.


### Demanding “Everything” in Legal Proceedings

- **Assertive Legal Position:** Requesting all relief or assets you believe you are entitled to is not illegal or coercive, provided your demands are made through the proper legal channels (motions, petitions, court hearings).
- **Court’s Role:** The court will decide what is fair and lawful based on the evidence, the law, and the specific circumstances of your case. Parties often start by requesting as much as possible, but the final outcome is determined by the judge.
- **Limits:** You cannot use threats or unlawful leverage to force the other party to give up rights or property. All negotiations and requests must remain within the bounds of the law and court procedure.


### Table: Legal and Ethical Boundaries

| Action | Is It Coercion? | Is It Illegal? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Refusing to mediate if other party won’t participate | No | No | You have no obligation to mediate if the other won’t |
| Demanding all relief/assets through court | No | No | Legal to request; court decides what is fair |
| Using threats to force settlement | Yes | Yes | Threats, blackmail, or unlawful pressure are prohibited |

### Key Points

- **You may pursue your legal claims fully if the other party is unwilling to mediate or reconcile.**
- **Your requests must be made through the court, not through threats or improper pressure.**
- **The court will ensure the process is fair and that no party is coerced or unlawfully deprived of their rights.**

**In summary:**
It is not coercion or illegal to stop trying to mediate or reconcile if the other party is unwilling, and to instead pursue all legal remedies available to you. Just ensure that all your actions remain within the law and court procedure.

---

## Refusing Mediation and Insisting on Counseling: Legal and Procedural Considerations

### 1. **Your Right to Choose Counseling Over Mediation**

- **Personal Preference:** You are allowed to state that you only want to participate in counseling, not mediation, as part of your approach to resolving the dispute.
- **Not Against the Rules:** There is no law or court rule in Washington State (including Snohomish County) that forces you to accept mediation if you sincerely believe counseling is the only path you are willing to try.
- **Court Discretion:** The court has discretion to order mediation, counseling, or neither, based on what it finds appropriate for the case and the parties’ circumstances.


### 2. **What Happens If You Refuse Mediation?**

- **No Penalty for Refusal:** You will not be penalized or found in violation of any rules simply for refusing mediation if you have a good-faith reason and are clear about your preference for counseling.
- **Court Consideration:** The judge may encourage or order mediation if it seems likely to help resolve the matter, but you can explain your reasons for preferring counseling. The court will consider your position and the other party’s willingness to mediate.
- **Proceeding to Litigation:** If both parties cannot agree on a dispute resolution method, or if court-ordered mediation/counseling fails, the case proceeds through the normal litigation process.


### 3. **Is It Coercion or Bad Faith to Insist on Counseling or “Fight for Everything”?**

- **Not Coercion:** Insisting on counseling as your only form of alternative dispute resolution is not coercion or bad faith. You are entitled to set your own boundaries for what you are willing to try.
- **Not Against the Law:** Saying you will “fight for everything” in court if counseling is not agreed to is not illegal or a violation of court rules, as long as you are not making threats or using unlawful pressure.
- **Court’s Role:** The court will ultimately decide what is fair based on the law and the evidence, regardless of either party’s negotiation stance.


### 4. **Best Practices and Court Perception**

- **Good Faith Participation:** Courts appreciate parties who are willing to participate in some form of dispute resolution, but they cannot force you to accept a method you do not believe in.
- **Clear Communication:** Clearly state your reasons for preferring counseling over mediation in your filings or communications with the court and the other party.
- **No Requirement to Settle:** You are never required to settle or compromise if you do not believe it is in your best interest.


### 5. **Summary Table: Your Options and Court Rules**

| Scenario | Is It Against the Rules? | Court’s Likely Response |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Refuse mediation, insist on counseling | No | Court may consider your preference |
| Refuse both, proceed to litigation | No | Case proceeds through court process |
| Only agree to counseling, not mediation | No | Court may order one or the other, or neither |
| Threaten unlawful action or use coercion | Yes | Not allowed, may face sanctions |

**In summary:**
You are within your rights to insist on counseling and decline mediation, even if the other party is only willing to mediate. This is not against the rules, not coercion, and not unlawful. The court will consider both parties’ positions and decide how the case should proceed. If agreement cannot be reached, the matter will simply continue through the normal court process.

# Asserting Your Rights and Pursuing Litigation

If reconciliation is not possible and you wish to assert your full legal rights and pursue litigation against Candi Lynn Brightwell and, where appropriate, her legal counsel, you are entitled to do so under Washington law. Below is a practical guide and draft framework for moving forward with robust legal action in Snohomish County Superior Court.

## 1. Assertive Litigation Strategy

- **Pursue All Available Claims:** You have the right to seek all remedies and relief to which you are entitled, including recovery of property, business assets, damages, and sanctions for any wrongful conduct.
- **No Obligation to Settle:** If the other party is unwilling to participate in counseling or meaningful settlement, you are not required to compromise or mediate.
- **Court Will Decide:** The court will determine the outcome based on the law, evidence, and arguments presented.


## 2. Litigation Actions to Consider

### A. File Comprehensive Motions and Petitions

- **Motion for Order to Show Cause re: Contempt:** For violations of court orders, denial of access, and misuse of business assets.
- **Motion for Temporary Orders:** For exclusive use of property, financial support, and asset protection.
- **Motion for Vulnerable Adult Protection Order:** If you qualify as a vulnerable adult under RCW 74.34.
- **Corporate Claims:** For conversion, tortious interference, destruction of property, and misuse of the resale certificate.


### B. Seek Full Relief

- **Restitution:** Recovery of all business and personal property wrongfully withheld or converted.
- **Damages:** Compensation for financial losses, lost profits, and harm caused by interference or misuse of assets.
- **Injunctive Relief:** Court orders prohibiting further interference, misuse, or access to business/property.
- **Attorney’s Fees and Costs:** Request that the court order the other party to pay your legal expenses if you prevail.
- **Sanctions:** For any willful violations of court orders or bad faith conduct.


## 3. Sample Draft Language for Your Motion

> **I, William Orley Miller Jr., respectfully request that the Court grant all relief to which I am entitled, including the return of my property and business assets, restitution for all losses, damages for interference with my business, and sanctions for any violations of court orders. I am prepared to pursue all available legal remedies through litigation, as attempts at reconciliation or alternative dispute resolution have failed.**

## 4. Addressing Her Lawyer’s Role

- **Direct Litigation Against Opposing Counsel:** You generally cannot sue her lawyer simply for representing her, unless there is clear evidence of attorney misconduct, fraud, or direct participation in unlawful acts. If you believe her lawyer has acted improperly, you may file a complaint with the Washington State Bar Association or seek court sanctions if warranted.
- **Focus on Main Claims:** The primary litigation should be directed at Candi Lynn Brightwell for her actions regarding property, business assets, and any violations of your rights.


## 5. Practical Steps

1. **Gather Evidence:** Collect all documentation, communications, receipts, and records of wrongful conduct.
2. **Draft and File Motions:** Use the sample motions and declarations previously provided as a foundation for your filings.
3. **Serve the Other Party:** Ensure all court documents are properly served on Candi and her attorney.
4. **Prepare for Hearings:** Be ready to present your case, evidence, and arguments in court.
5. **Request Maximum Relief:** Clearly state in your filings that you seek all relief and remedies available under the law.

## 6. Table: Litigation Roadmap

| Step | Action Item | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Evidence Collection | Gather all supporting documentation | Property, business, communications |
| Draft Motions | Prepare motions for all claims | Use court-approved format |
| Filing \& Service | File with court, serve opposing party | Required for due process |
| Court Hearings | Attend and present your case | Bring evidence, witnesses if needed |
| Enforcement | Pursue enforcement of court orders | Restitution, contempt, sanctions |

## 7. Important Reminders

- **Remain Professional:** All communications and filings should remain factual, respectful, and focused on legal claims.
- **No Retaliation:** Do not threaten or harass the other party or her lawyer; rely on court procedures for all remedies.
- **Consult an Attorney:** Present your drafts and evidence to your lawyer for review to ensure compliance with all local rules and to maximize your chances of success.

**In summary:**
If you no longer wish to pursue reconciliation, you are fully within your rights to litigate for everything to which you are entitled. The court process is designed to resolve such disputes, and you can seek all available legal remedies for any harm or loss you have suffered.

## Is It a Conflict to Email the Lawyer Directly About Counseling Instead of Filing a Motion?

### Short Answer

**No, it is not a conflict to email the opposing lawyer directly to request counseling instead of filing a motion.** In fact, this is a common, professional, and appropriate way to communicate in legal matters, especially when you are trying to resolve issues outside of formal court proceedings.

### Why Direct Communication with Her Lawyer Is Appropriate

- **Professional Courtesy:** Lawyers and parties often communicate directly with opposing counsel to discuss settlement, procedural matters, or possible agreements before involving the court.
- **No Ethical Conflict:** As long as you are not represented by your own attorney (or if you copy your attorney on the email), you are allowed to communicate directly with the other party’s lawyer.
- **Not a Substitute for Court Orders:** If you and the other party reach an agreement through their lawyer, you can formalize it with the court later. If you do not reach agreement, you can still file a motion.


### When Communication Might Be a Problem

- **If You Are Represented:** If you have your own lawyer, you should let your lawyer handle all communications with opposing counsel. Direct contact could violate professional rules.
- **If There Are Protection or No-Contact Orders:** If there are court orders prohibiting contact, always communicate through lawyers or the court, not directly with the other party.
- **If You Want a Court Order:** Simply emailing the lawyer does not create a binding court order. If you want the court to compel counseling, you must file a formal motion.


### Practical Steps

1. **Draft a Professional Email:** Clearly state your request for counseling, your reasons, and your willingness to discuss options.
2. **Wait for a Response:** The lawyer may discuss your request with their client and respond with their position.
3. **No Agreement? File a Motion:** If you cannot reach agreement, you can proceed to file a motion with the court to formally request counseling.

### Table: Email vs. Motion for Counseling

| Method | Is It a Conflict? | Creates Court Order? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Email to Lawyer | No | No | Good for informal resolution |
| File Motion in Court | No | Yes | Required for enforceable court order |
| Both (Email then Motion) | No | Yes (if motion filed) | Often best practice |

**In summary:**
It is entirely proper to email the opposing lawyer to request counseling before filing a motion. This approach is not a conflict, does not violate any rules, and is often encouraged to resolve matters efficiently. If informal discussion fails, you retain the right to seek a formal court order through the usual motion process.

- **Motion for Marital Counseling:** File a motion in your case explicitly requesting that the court order both parties to participate in marital counseling. Clearly state that your intent is to explore reconciliation and give the relationship an honest chance.
- **Supporting Declaration:** Submit a declaration explaining your sincere desire for reconciliation, the history of your relationship, and why you believe counseling could be beneficial. Be honest about any legal or safety concerns and acknowledge the current status of your proceedings.


### What to Include in Your Motion

- **Case Caption:** Use the correct court name, case number, and party names.
- **Title:** "Motion for Marital Counseling" or "Motion for Court-Ordered Marital Counseling."
- **Introduction:** Briefly state who you are and your request for marital counseling.
- **Legal Basis:** Reference the court’s broad authority to order counseling under RCW 26.09.030 (even though it is more commonly used in divorce or separation cases with children, the court retains discretion in all family law matters).
- **Reasons for Request:** Explain your hope to repair the relationship, your willingness to participate in good faith, and any benefits you see for both parties.
- **Request for Relief:** Ask the court to order both parties to attend marital counseling with a qualified provider.


### Example Language for Your Declaration

> I, William Orley Miller Jr., respectfully request that the Court order both parties to participate in marital counseling. Despite our current disputes, I sincerely wish to attempt reconciliation and believe that professional counseling could help us address our issues constructively. I am willing to participate in good faith and hope the other party will do the same.

### What the Court Will Consider

- **Willingness of Both Parties:** The court is more likely to order marital counseling if both parties are open to it. If the other party objects, the court may be less inclined to order joint sessions, especially if there are protection orders or safety concerns.
- **Best Interests and Safety:** The court will not order counseling if it believes it could endanger either party or is not appropriate given the circumstances.
- **Alternative Options:** If marital counseling is not possible, the court may suggest individual counseling or mediation as alternatives.


### Table: Court Response to Marital Counseling Requests

| Scenario | Court’s Likely Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| Both parties agree to counseling | Likely to order or permit counseling |
| One party objects | Less likely to order, may suggest alternatives |
| Safety or protection order issues | Unlikely to order joint counseling |

### Practical Steps

1. **Draft and File Motion:** Clearly request marital counseling in your motion.
2. **Serve the Other Party:** Provide copies to Candi and her attorney.
3. **Prepare for Hearing:** Be ready to explain your reasons to the judge.
4. **Respect Court’s Decision:** The court will weigh all factors and may grant, deny, or modify your request.

**In summary:**
You can formally request marital counseling in hopes of reconciliation by filing a motion and supporting declaration with the court. The court will consider your request, the other party’s willingness, and any safety or legal concerns before making a decision. This approach is appropriate and demonstrates your good faith effort to resolve the relationship if possible.

## Does Requesting Marital Counseling Diminish the Severity or Need for a Protection Order?

### Key Points

- **Requesting Marital Counseling Does Not Lessen Severity:**
Asking the court for marital counseling does **not** mean the situation is less serious, nor does it suggest that you do not need a protection order. Courts understand that people may want to try reconciliation even in difficult or high-conflict situations.
- **Protection Orders Are Based on Safety and Evidence:**
The court evaluates the need for a protection order based on the specific facts, evidence of harm or threat, and the legal standards under Washington law (such as RCW 26.50 for domestic violence or RCW 74.34 for vulnerable adults). Your request for counseling is considered separately from the evidence supporting your need for protection.
- **No Waiver of Rights:**
By requesting counseling, you are **not waiving** your right to seek a protection order or any other relief. The court can grant both—order counseling (if appropriate) and issue or maintain a protection order for your safety.
- **Court’s Primary Concern Is Safety:**
If the court finds there is a credible threat or ongoing harm, it will prioritize issuing or maintaining a protection order, regardless of your willingness to try counseling.


### How Courts View Such Requests

| Action Taken | Does It Reduce Severity? | Does It Waive Protection Rights? | Court’s Likely Response |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Request marital counseling | No | No | Considers both safety and reconciliation |
| Request protection order | No | No | Evaluates evidence and legal standards |
| Request both | No | No | May grant both or prioritize safety |

### Practical Considerations

- **Be Clear in Your Filings:**
If you want both counseling and protection, state this clearly. For example, you can say you wish to attempt reconciliation but still require court protection for your safety and well-being.
- **Court May Set Conditions:**
If a protection order is in place, the court may only allow counseling if it can be done safely (such as separate sessions or with safeguards).
- **No Negative Inference:**
The court will not assume you are exaggerating the situation or that you are safe just because you are open to counseling. Your safety remains the court’s priority.


### Sample Language for Your Declaration

> My request for marital counseling is made in the hope of resolving our issues if possible, but I continue to believe that a protection order is necessary for my safety and well-being. I ask the court to consider both requests and to prioritize safety in any orders it issues.

**In summary:**
Requesting marital counseling does not reduce the seriousness of your situation or imply that you do not need a protection order. You can pursue both, and the court will weigh each request on its own merits, always prioritizing safety.

## Emailing the Lawyer About Counseling Instead of Filing a Motion

You are entirely within your rights to communicate your interest in marital counseling directly to Candi Lynn Brightwell’s lawyer by email, especially if you do not want to make this a formal court issue while pursuing other motions (such as for contempt).

### Why This Approach Is Appropriate

- **Professional and Common Practice:** It is standard to attempt informal resolution or discuss settlement options—including counseling—through the other party’s attorney before involving the court.
- **No Legal Requirement to File a Motion:** You are not obligated to file a motion for every request. If you only want to explore counseling and do not want a court order, an email is sufficient.
- **Keeps the Issue Informal:** By raising the topic outside of court filings, you avoid making it part of the official record or complicating your primary litigation strategy.
- **No Conflict or Procedural Problem:** This does not create any conflict or procedural issue, provided you communicate respectfully and do not violate any protection or no-contact orders.


### How to Structure Your Email

- **Be Clear and Concise:** Briefly state your interest in marital counseling and your reasons for requesting it.
- **Acknowledge Other Proceedings:** Mention that you are pursuing other motions (such as for contempt) but would like to keep this request informal.
- **Invite a Response:** Ask if Candi is willing to consider counseling and request a reply.
- **No Pressure or Threats:** Keep the tone cooperative and non-confrontational.


#### Sample Email Outline

> Subject: Request for Marital Counseling
>
> Dear [Lawyer’s Name],
>
> I am writing to express my sincere interest in participating in marital counseling with Candi, in the hope that we might address our issues constructively. I understand that there are ongoing legal proceedings, and I am pursuing motions for contempt and other relief through the court. However, I would prefer to keep this request for counseling informal and outside of court filings at this time.
>
> Please let me know if your client would be open to discussing or participating in marital counseling.
>
> Thank you for your consideration.
>
> Sincerely,
> William Orley Miller Jr.

### What to Expect

- **The Lawyer May Relay Your Request:** The attorney will likely communicate your interest to Candi and respond with her position.
- **No Court Order Issued:** Unless both parties agree and formalize it, there will be no court-ordered counseling.
- **You Retain All Legal Rights:** If counseling is declined or does not proceed, you can continue with your motions for contempt and other relief as planned.


### Summary Table: Approaches to Counseling Request

| Approach | Formal Court Order? | Part of Official Record? | Flexibility | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Email to Opposing Lawyer | No | No | High | Informal, no obligation |
| Motion Filed with Court | Yes | Yes | Lower | Becomes part of litigation |

**In summary:**
You can email Candi’s lawyer to request marital counseling without filing a motion or making it part of your formal court case. This is a practical, non-confrontational way to explore reconciliation while pursuing your other legal remedies. If the request is declined, you are free to continue with your litigation strategy.

# Contacting Opposing Counsel on Their Personal Phone: Rules and Considerations

## Overview

Contacting an opposing party’s lawyer on their personal phone—especially if the number was obtained through a background check or other informal means—raises ethical and professional considerations governed by rules of professional conduct and legal practice standards.

## Key Points Regarding Contacting Opposing Counsel

### 1. **Ethical Rules on Communication with Opposing Counsel**

- Lawyers are generally expected to communicate through official or business channels rather than personal phones unless prior consent is given.
- The Washington Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), particularly Rule 4.2, regulate communications with persons represented by counsel and the conduct of lawyers in such communications.
- Direct communication with opposing counsel should be professional, respectful, and preferably through known business contact information.


### 2. **Is Calling a Lawyer’s Personal Phone Allowed?**

- **Not explicitly prohibited, but not recommended:** There is no absolute prohibition against calling an attorney on a personal phone, but it is generally discouraged unless it is the only or best way to reach them and the call is professional and appropriate.
- **Consent and context matter:** If the lawyer has provided or consented to the use of their personal phone for professional communication, it is acceptable. Otherwise, it may be viewed as intrusive or unprofessional.
- **Avoid harassment or repeated unsolicited calls:** Excessive or inappropriate use of personal contact information can raise ethical concerns or complaints.


### 3. **Best Practices**

- **Use official contact information:** Whenever possible, contact opposing counsel using their official office phone number or email address.
- **If personal contact is used, be professional:** Keep the communication focused on case-related matters, respectful, and during reasonable hours.
- **Document communications:** Keep records of attempts to contact counsel and the nature of communications for transparency.
- **If unsure, seek guidance:** Consult with your own attorney or the Washington State Bar Association’s ethics hotline for advice on specific situations.


### 4. **Potential Risks**

| Risk | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- |
| Perceived intrusion or harassment | Calling a personal number without consent may be seen as intrusive |
| Ethical complaints | Opposing counsel could file a complaint if contact is inappropriate |
| Professional reputation | Unprofessional conduct can harm your credibility in court |
| No legal obligation to answer | The lawyer is not obligated to answer personal calls |

## Summary Table: Contacting Opposing Counsel on Personal Phone

| Factor | Recommendation/Rule |
| :-- | :-- |
| Use of personal phone number | Allowed if consented; otherwise discouraged |
| Professionalism | Always maintain respectful and case-related communication |
| Documentation | Keep records of all communications |
| Ethical concerns | Avoid harassment or repeated unsolicited calls |
| Alternative contact methods | Prefer official business phone or email |

## Conclusion

While it is not strictly against the rules to call opposing counsel on their personal phone if you have obtained the number, it is generally **not recommended** unless you have explicit consent or no other means of contact. The best practice is to communicate through official channels to maintain professionalism and avoid ethical issues.

If you are uncertain about the appropriateness of such contact, it is advisable to consult your own attorney or seek guidance from the Washington State Bar Association’s ethics resources.

## Finding a Lawyer’s Phone Number Online

If you search for a lawyer’s name—such as Dexter L. Callahan—using Google or another search engine, it is common for their professional contact information to appear in the results. For attorneys, this typically includes:

- Office phone number
- Law firm website or attorney profile
- Office address
- Sometimes an email address


### Example: Dexter L. Callahan

When searching for "Dexter L. Callahan," his professional phone numbers and contact details do appear on reputable legal directories and his law firm’s website. For instance:

- **Van Siclen Stocks Firkins (his law firm):**
    - Main office phone: (253) 859-8899 [^26_1][^26_2]
- **Direct listings on legal directories:**
    - (253) 452-4064 and (253) 452-4073 are also listed as professional contact numbers for Dexter L. Callahan in Auburn, WA [^26_3][^26_4].

These numbers are intended for business and client use. It is standard practice for law firms and lawyers to publish their office numbers online for accessibility.

### Professional Contact vs. Personal Numbers

- **Professional/Office Numbers:**
These are appropriate to use for legal communications and are meant to be public.
- **Personal Numbers:**
If you find a personal cell phone number not listed on official law firm sites or legal directories, it is best to avoid using it unless you have explicit permission or it was provided to you directly by the lawyer.


### Best Practice

- Use the office or business number listed on the law firm’s website or in legal directories.
- Avoid calling any number that appears to be a personal line unless it is clearly marked as a business contact or you have been invited to use it.

| Lawyers.com | (253) 452-4073 | Office/Direct |

**In summary:**

## Is It Unethical to Request an "Off the Record" Conversation with Opposing Counsel?

### Key Considerations

- **Not Unethical by Itself:**
Simply emailing opposing counsel (such as Candi’s lawyer) and asking to have an “off the record” conversation is not inherently unethical. Lawyers regularly engage in informal discussions to explore settlement or clarify issues, and these conversations can be helpful for both sides.
- **Professional Boundaries:**
The attorney is still bound by professional and ethical rules, including confidentiality and the duty to act in their client’s best interests. “Off the record” in legal practice typically means the conversation is informal and not part of the official court record, but it does not override ethical obligations or legal requirements.
- **No Obligation to Agree:**
The lawyer may decline to have any conversation “off the record,” or may clarify what that means in the context of your case. They may also want to confirm with their client before agreeing to any informal discussion.
- **Transparency and Documentation:**
Even if you discuss matters informally, anything material to the case should eventually be confirmed in writing or through formal court filings if agreement is reached. Neither party can use “off the record” as a way to make binding agreements that avoid court oversight.


### When Issues Might Arise

- **Misunderstanding the Term:**
“Off the record” does not mean the lawyer can hide information from their client or the court, nor does it mean the conversation is privileged or confidential in the way attorney-client communications are.
- **Attempting to Circumvent Rules:**
If you use “off the record” to try to get the lawyer to violate ethical rules (e.g., conceal information, act against their client’s interests), that would be improper. But simply requesting a candid discussion is not a violation.


### Best Practices

- **Be Clear About Intent:**
If you want an informal, candid discussion, say so, but understand the lawyer may still need to share the substance with their client.
- **Keep Communications Professional:**
Remain respectful and avoid discussing anything you would not want eventually disclosed in court if necessary.
- **Document Important Agreements:**
Any agreements or understandings should be confirmed in writing to avoid misunderstandings.


### Table: “Off the Record” Conversations with Opposing Counsel

| Action | Is It Unethical? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Requesting an informal/off the record talk | No | Common in legal practice; lawyer may or may not agree |
| Asking lawyer to conceal info from client | Yes | Lawyer cannot ethically hide material info from their client |
| Making secret, binding agreements | No, but not enforceable | All agreements should be documented for court |

**In summary:**
Requesting an “off the record” conversation with opposing counsel by email is not unethical or improper, as long as your intent is simply to have a candid, informal discussion. The lawyer remains bound by ethical duties to their client, and any important agreements should be documented formally.

---

## Could Requesting “Off the Record” Talks with Opposing Counsel Harm Your Case?

### General Impact

Requesting an “off the record” conversation with opposing counsel is not inherently harmful to your case, but there are important considerations:

- **Not an Admission of Weakness:** Courts and opposing counsel do not interpret such requests as an admission that your legal position is weak. Informal discussions are a normal part of legal practice and can actually demonstrate your willingness to resolve issues efficiently.
- **No Legal Waiver:** Simply asking for an informal or candid discussion does not waive any of your legal rights or claims.
- **No Binding Effect:** Unless you make formal admissions or agreements during the conversation and later confirm them in writing or court, informal talks are generally not binding.


### Potential Risks

While the request itself is not harmful, there are scenarios where it could have negative consequences if not handled carefully:


| Potential Risk | How to Avoid Harm |
| :-- | :-- |
| Miscommunication | Be clear that you are not making admissions or waiving rights. |
| Unintended Admissions | Avoid discussing sensitive facts or legal strategies that could be used against you. |
| Misuse of “Off the Record” | Remember that lawyers may still share the substance with their client. Nothing is truly “secret.” |
| Perception of Impropriety | Keep all communications professional and respectful. |

### Best Practices

- **Stay Professional:** Keep your tone respectful and your content focused on resolution, not on conceding legal points.
- **Clarify Intent:** Make it clear you are seeking informal discussion to explore settlement or clarify misunderstandings, not to make binding agreements.
- **Document Agreements:** If any understanding is reached, insist on confirming it in writing.
- **Avoid Sensitive Disclosures:** Do not share information you would not want the court or opposing party to know.


### When It Might Backfire

- If you appear desperate to settle at any cost, the other side may perceive you as vulnerable and use this in negotiations.
- If you make statements that contradict your formal court filings, those could be referenced later.
- If you attempt to conceal material facts or ask the lawyer to act unethically, this could harm your credibility and case.


### Summary Table: Effects of Requesting “Off the Record” Talks

| Action | Harmful to Case? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Requesting informal discussion | No | Standard practice, not harmful by itself |
| Making admissions or concessions | Potentially | Only if you reveal harmful information |
| Attempting to hide facts or act unethically | Yes | Can damage credibility and legal standing |
| Failing to document important agreements | Potentially | Can lead to misunderstandings or disputes |

**In summary:**
Requesting an “off the record” conversation with opposing counsel is not, by itself, harmful to your case. It is a common and accepted practice. The key is to remain professional, avoid making admissions or concessions you wouldn’t want used against you, and ensure that any important agreements are documented. As long as you follow these guidelines, such a request should not negatively impact your legal position.

# Draft Email to Opposing Counsel Requesting Marital Counseling

Below is a professional and respectful email template you can use to communicate your interest in marital counseling to Candi Lynn Brightwell’s attorney. This email keeps the request informal and separate from your ongoing court filings, as discussed.

**Subject:** Request for Marital Counseling Discussion

Dear Mr. Callahan,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to express my sincere interest in participating in marital counseling with Ms. Brightwell. Despite the ongoing legal proceedings and my pursuit of other motions through the court, I still believe that counseling could provide an opportunity for us to address our issues constructively and, if possible, work toward reconciliation.

At this time, I would prefer to keep this request informal and outside of any court filings. My intention is simply to explore whether both parties would be willing to participate in professional counseling sessions, with the hope of resolving matters amicably and efficiently.

Please let me know if your client would be open to discussing or participating in marital counseling. If she is not interested, I understand and will proceed with the legal process as necessary.

Thank you for your attention to this request. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
William Orley Miller Jr.

**Tips:**

- Send the email from your preferred account and keep a copy for your records.
- Do not include any admissions or sensitive legal information beyond your request.
- If you do not receive a response within a reasonable time, you may proceed with your formal legal strategy as planned.

This approach maintains professionalism, keeps the issue informal, and demonstrates your good faith effort to resolve matters outside of court.

# Draft Email Requesting an "Off the Record" Conversation

Below is a professional template you can use to request an informal, off-the-record conversation with Candi Lynn Brightwell’s attorney. This email avoids mentioning counseling or any specific settlement topic and simply seeks a candid discussion.

**Subject:** Request for Informal Discussion

Dear Mr. Callahan,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out to see if you would be open to having an informal, off-the-record conversation regarding the ongoing matters between myself and Ms. Brightwell. My intention is to discuss certain aspects candidly and outside the formal court process, if you are comfortable with that approach.

Please let me know if you are willing to have such a conversation, and if so, your preferred method and time for us to connect.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
William Orley Miller Jr.

**Tips for Sending:**

- Use your preferred email account and keep a copy for your records.
- Remain professional and avoid discussing sensitive legal strategies or making admissions in any informal conversation.
- If the attorney is not comfortable with an off-the-record discussion, respect their position and continue with formal communications as needed.

This approach is appropriate, professional, and does not create any legal or ethical issues as long as the conversation remains respectful and within the bounds of proper legal conduct.

## Is It Usual for Lawyers to Try to Settle Outside of Court?

Yes, it is very common—and often encouraged—for lawyers to attempt to settle disputes outside of court, even when each side is determined to "win" or achieve the best possible outcome for their client.

### Why Settlement Is Common

- **Efficiency:** Settling outside of court saves time, money, and resources for both parties.
- **Control:** Settlement allows parties to shape the terms of their agreement, rather than leaving the outcome entirely in the hands of a judge.
- **Uncertainty Reduction:** Trials are unpredictable; settlement provides more certainty and finality.
- **Confidentiality:** Settlements can remain private, while court proceedings are generally public record.
- **Court Encouragement:** Courts frequently encourage or even require parties to attempt settlement or mediation before proceeding to trial, especially in civil and family law cases.


### Typical Settlement Practices

- **Informal Discussions:** Lawyers often reach out to opposing counsel for candid, off-the-record conversations to explore possible resolutions.
- **Mediation:** A neutral third party may facilitate negotiations to help the parties reach an agreement.
- **Settlement Offers:** Written or verbal offers may be exchanged, sometimes multiple times, before an agreement is reached or the case proceeds to trial.
- **Court-Ordered ADR:** Many courts require some form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), such as mediation or arbitration, before a case can go to trial.


### Table: Litigation vs. Settlement

| Factor | Litigation (Trial) | Settlement (Out of Court) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Cost | High | Usually lower |
| Time | Months to years | Can be resolved quickly |
| Control | Judge decides | Parties decide |
| Publicity | Public record | Can be confidential |
| Outcome Certainty | Unpredictable | Negotiated and agreed |

### Key Takeaway

**It is standard practice for lawyers to pursue settlement discussions—even while preparing for trial—because it is usually in the best interest of their clients.** This does not mean they are not trying to "win"; rather, they are seeking the most favorable and efficient resolution possible. If settlement fails, the case can still proceed to court.

---

## Can Your Request Be Seen as a Good Faith Effort?

Yes, reaching out to the opposing attorney to request an informal, off-the-record conversation—especially before escalating matters in court—is widely recognized as a **good faith effort** in legal proceedings.

### Why This Is Viewed as Good Faith

- **Willingness to Communicate:** Initiating informal discussions shows you are open to resolving issues collaboratively, rather than insisting on litigation as the only path.
- **Attempt to Settle:** Courts and legal professionals appreciate parties who try to settle or clarify disputes outside of formal court action, as this saves time and resources for everyone involved.
- **Respect for Process:** By contacting the lawyer professionally and not the opposing party directly, you demonstrate respect for legal protocols and boundaries.
- **Transparency:** Documenting your attempts to communicate and resolve issues can later be shown to the court as evidence of your reasonable and constructive approach.


### How Courts and Lawyers Interpret Good Faith

| Action | Seen as Good Faith? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Requesting informal/off-the-record discussion | Yes | Shows openness and willingness to resolve issues |
| Attempting to negotiate before filing motions | Yes | Courts prefer settlement efforts before litigation |
| Refusing to communicate or escalating immediately | No | May be seen as combative or uncooperative |

### Benefits of Demonstrating Good Faith

- **Positive Court Perception:** Judges are more likely to view you favorably if you have tried to resolve matters amicably before seeking court intervention.
- **Potential for Settlement:** Good faith efforts can sometimes lead to a quicker, less costly resolution.
- **Reduced Risk of Sanctions:** Courts may penalize parties who refuse to negotiate or act unreasonably, but those who show good faith are protected from such criticism.

**In summary:**
Your approach—requesting an informal conversation with the opposing lawyer before taking further legal steps—will almost always be seen as a good faith effort by both the court and legal professionals. It reflects a reasonable, constructive, and professional attitude in resolving disputes.

# Can You Still Make Good Faith Settlement or Informal Requests Before a Contempt Hearing?

Yes, you can absolutely reach out to opposing counsel for informal, off-the-record discussions—even if a contempt of court hearing is already scheduled for July 11th.

## Key Points

- **The Scheduled Hearing Does Not Prevent Informal Talks:**
The existence of a scheduled contempt hearing does not limit your ability to communicate with the other party’s lawyer. Informal settlement discussions are common at any stage of a case, including after hearings are set.
- **Good Faith Efforts Are Still Encouraged:**
Courts and legal professionals view attempts to resolve disputes outside of court—even close to a hearing date—as a sign of good faith. If your informal efforts lead to a resolution, you can potentially avoid or narrow the issues for the hearing.
- **No Negative Impact on Your Case:**
Reaching out for an informal conversation or attempting to settle does not weaken your legal position. In fact, it can be presented to the court as evidence that you are acting reasonably and constructively.
- **Hearing Will Proceed Unless Resolved:**
Unless both parties reach an agreement and notify the court, the contempt hearing will go forward as scheduled. Any agreements or resolutions should be documented and, if necessary, filed with the court to formally resolve or continue the hearing.


## What You Can Do

- **Continue Good Faith Communication:**
You may email or call opposing counsel to discuss possible settlement, clarification, or resolution of issues—even with the hearing date approaching.
- **Document Your Efforts:**
Keep records of your communications. If you reach a settlement, make sure it is put in writing and, if needed, submitted to the court.
- **Prepare for the Hearing:**
If no agreement is reached, be ready to proceed with the contempt hearing on July 11th.


## Practical Table: Settlement Efforts Before a Hearing

| Action | Allowed Before Hearing? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Informal talks with lawyer | Yes | Common and encouraged at any stage |
| Settlement/clarification attempts | Yes | Can lead to resolution or stipulation |
| Filing motions for other relief | Yes | As long as deadlines are met |
| Canceling hearing if resolved | Yes (with court notice) | Must notify court and opposing party |

## Summary

- You can make informal or settlement requests to opposing counsel at any time, including before a scheduled contempt hearing.
- Such actions are considered good faith efforts and do not undermine your legal position.
- The hearing will proceed unless both parties agree to resolve the matter and inform the court.

**In short:**
A scheduled contempt hearing does not prevent you from seeking informal resolution or communicating with the other party’s lawyer. This approach is professional, strategic, and fully within your rights.

# Should You Mention Marital Counseling in the Email to Opposing Counsel?

## Key Considerations

- **Purpose of the Email:** If your primary goal is to request an informal, off-the-record conversation with opposing counsel, you do not need to mention your interest in marital counseling in the initial email.
- **Focus on Process, Not Substance:** Keeping the email neutral and focused on the desire for candid discussion allows you to gauge the attorney’s willingness to communicate informally before introducing specific topics.
- **Flexibility:** An off-the-record conversation can cover a range of topics, including marital counseling, but you can decide whether or not to raise that issue once the attorney agrees to talk.


## When to Mention Marital Counseling

- **If It’s Your Main Agenda:** If your main reason for requesting the conversation is to propose marital counseling, you may briefly mention it to provide context.
- **If You’re Open to Broader Discussion:** If you want to keep the conversation open to any possible resolution, it’s best to leave the topic out of the initial email and bring it up during the discussion if appropriate.


## Sample Approaches

### 1. **Email Without Mentioning Marital Counseling**

> Subject: Request for Off-the-Record Conversation
>
> Dear Mr. Callahan,
>
> I am reaching out to see if you would be open to a brief, off-the-record conversation regarding the ongoing matters between myself and Ms. Brightwell. My intention is to discuss certain aspects candidly and outside the formal court process, should you be comfortable with that approach.
>
> Please let me know if you are willing to have such a discussion, and, if so, your preferred method and time for us to connect.
>
> Thank you for your consideration.
>
> Sincerely,
> William Orley Miller Jr.

### 2. **Email Mentioning Marital Counseling (Optional)**

> Subject: Request for Off-the-Record Conversation
>
> Dear Mr. Callahan,
>
> I am reaching out to see if you would be open to a brief, off-the-record conversation regarding the ongoing matters between myself and Ms. Brightwell. One topic I would like to discuss is the possibility of marital counseling, as I believe it could be beneficial to address our issues constructively.
>
> Please let me know if you are willing to have such a discussion, and, if so, your preferred method and time for us to connect.
>
> Thank you for your consideration.
>
> Sincerely,
> William Orley Miller Jr.

## Summary Table: Pros and Cons

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Do not mention marital counseling | Keeps discussion open and neutral | May require follow-up to clarify |
| Mention marital counseling | Sets clear agenda if that’s your goal | Limits flexibility in discussion |

## Recommendation

If you are unsure whether marital counseling will be well received or want to keep your options open, **do not mention it in the initial email**. Instead, use the conversation to gauge openness and introduce the topic if the discussion feels appropriate. If marital counseling is your sole or primary reason for reaching out, you may briefly reference it, but this is not required.

# Framing a Counseling Request to Promote Understanding and Cooperation

Requesting counseling in a legal or high-conflict context requires careful wording to foster openness, minimize defensiveness, and encourage a collaborative response. Here’s how to frame your request for marital counseling in a way that promotes understanding and cooperation:

## 1. **Emphasize Shared Goals and Mutual Benefit**

- Express that your primary aim is to find constructive solutions and improve communication.
- Highlight that counseling is intended to benefit both parties, not just yourself.
- Acknowledge any challenges or misunderstandings and express a genuine desire to address them together.

**Example:**
> My hope is that, through counseling, we can both gain a better understanding of each other’s perspectives and work toward resolving our issues in a constructive, respectful manner.

## 2. **Use Respectful and Non-Accusatory Language**

- Avoid blaming or focusing on past grievances.
- Use “I” statements to describe your feelings and intentions, rather than “you” statements that may sound accusatory.

**Example:**
> I believe that professional counseling could help us communicate more effectively and explore whether there is a path forward for us, regardless of the outcome.

## 3. **Acknowledge the Other Person’s Autonomy**

- Make it clear that you respect their right to decline or consider alternatives.
- Invite their input on the process or counselor selection.

**Example:**
> I understand that this is a personal decision, and I respect whatever choice you make. If you’re open to it, I would appreciate your thoughts on how we might proceed or if you have a preferred counselor.

## 4. **Frame Counseling as a Step Toward Clarity**

- Present counseling as a way to gain clarity, not necessarily to force reconciliation.
- Emphasize that the process can help both parties understand their needs and options moving forward.

**Example:**
> I see counseling as an opportunity for us both to gain clarity about our situation and to ensure that any decisions we make are well-informed and considered.

## 5. **Highlight Practical Benefits**

- Note that counseling can save time, reduce conflict, and potentially minimize legal expenses.
- Stress the value of resolving issues outside of court, if possible.

**Example:**
> I believe that working with a counselor could help us address our concerns more efficiently and possibly avoid further legal proceedings, which would benefit both of us.

## 6. **Sample Framing for a Written Request**

> Dear [Recipient],
>
> I am reaching out to suggest that we consider participating in professional counseling together. My intention is not to revisit past disagreements, but to create a space where we can communicate openly and work toward mutual understanding. I believe this process could help us both, regardless of the outcome, and may even make our current situation less stressful and more manageable.
>
> I respect your perspective and am open to any thoughts or preferences you may have about how to proceed. Please let me know if you would be willing to discuss this further.
>
> Thank you for considering this request.

## 7. **Summary Table: Key Framing Strategies**

| Strategy | Purpose | Example Phrase |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Emphasize mutual benefit | Reduce defensiveness | "Benefit both of us" |
| Use “I” statements | Avoid blame | "I believe counseling could help us communicate..." |
| Acknowledge autonomy | Show respect | "I respect your decision either way" |
| Frame as clarity-seeking | Lower pressure for reconciliation | "Gain clarity about our situation" |
| Highlight practical benefits | Motivate cooperation | "Avoid further legal proceedings" |

**In summary:**
Frame your counseling request as a collaborative, respectful, and practical step toward resolving issues and improving communication. By focusing on shared benefits, using non-accusatory language, and respecting the other party’s autonomy, you increase the likelihood of a cooperative and positive response.

# Documenting Your Longstanding Request for Marriage Counseling

## Key Point

You have a well-established history of requesting marriage counseling from Candi Lynn Brightwell, and this effort began **well before any legal disputes or litigation arose**.

## How to Emphasize This in Your Legal Communications

### 1. Statement for Declarations or Motions

When preparing declarations, motions, or correspondence with the court or opposing counsel, use clear, factual language to establish your good faith:

> I have consistently and sincerely requested that Ms. Brightwell and I participate in marriage counseling, beginning long before any legal proceedings or court involvement. My intention has always been to address our issues constructively and explore the possibility of reconciliation through professional guidance.

### 2. Why This Matters

- **Demonstrates Good Faith:** Shows the court and opposing counsel that your interest in counseling is genuine and not a litigation tactic.
- **Clarifies Intent:** Underscores that your goal was to resolve issues amicably, not to escalate conflict.
- **Supports Your Position:** If the other party claims you are acting in bad faith or using counseling as leverage, this record counters that narrative.


## Sample Language for Legal Filings

You may include a section in your declaration or motion such as:

> **History of Counseling Requests**
>
> Prior to the commencement of any legal action, I repeatedly asked Ms. Brightwell to join me in marriage counseling. These requests were made out of a sincere desire to improve our relationship and avoid the need for legal intervention. I remain open to counseling as a means of resolving our differences.

## Practical Tips

- **Document Past Requests:** If you have texts, emails, or other records showing your prior requests for counseling, gather and reference them as supporting exhibits.
- **Stay Consistent:** Continue to express your willingness for counseling in all legal and informal communications, reinforcing your ongoing good faith.
- **Clarify Scope:** Make clear that your request for counseling is not conditional on litigation outcomes, but stems from a longstanding desire to address issues constructively.


## Summary Table: Timeline of Counseling Requests

| Time Period | Action Taken | Purpose/Intent |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Before legal dispute | Repeatedly requested counseling | Sincere effort to reconcile |
| After legal dispute | Continued to request counseling | Maintain good faith, resolve issues |

**In summary:**
Your record of strongly requesting marriage counseling from Candi Lynn Brightwell long before any legal proceedings demonstrates your good faith and sincere desire to resolve matters constructively. This history should be clearly documented and referenced in your legal filings to support your position.

---

# Addressing Prior Counseling and Issues of Good Faith

## Acknowledging Prior Counseling Efforts

It is important to clearly document that you and Candi Lynn Brightwell did, in fact, participate in counseling together at one point. This demonstrates your willingness to seek resolution and to address relationship issues through professional means.

## Concerns About Good Faith Participation

You have noted that the counseling was not fully effective because:

- Candi was allegedly confiding in her daughter about matters discussed in counseling, rather than addressing them directly within the sessions.
- She was not fully truthful during counseling, which undermined the process and prevented genuine progress.


## How to Frame This in Legal Filings or Communications

### 1. Statement for Declarations or Motions

When preparing a declaration or supporting statement, you may use language such as:

> I wish to clarify that we did participate in counseling together prior to or during the course of our disputes. However, I believe the process was compromised because Ms. Brightwell was not fully forthcoming in the sessions and was simultaneously confiding in her daughter about issues that should have been addressed transparently in counseling. This limited the effectiveness of the counseling and prevented us from making genuine progress toward resolution.

### 2. Why This Is Relevant

- **Demonstrates Good Faith:** Shows you made sincere efforts to resolve matters through counseling.
- **Explains Lack of Progress:** Provides context for why counseling did not lead to reconciliation or meaningful resolution.
- **Supports Future Requests:** If you seek further counseling, mediation, or court intervention, the court will understand the history and the reasons for your current position.


### 3. Practical Tips

- **Be Factual and Non-Accusatory:** State your observations and concerns without making inflammatory accusations.
- **Emphasize Your Intent:** Reiterate your ongoing willingness to resolve matters constructively, while acknowledging the limitations of past efforts.
- **Document the Timeline:** If possible, specify when the counseling occurred and how it related to the broader context of your relationship and legal proceedings.


## Sample Language for Legal Documents

> While we did attend counseling together, I believe the process was undermined because Ms. Brightwell was not fully forthcoming in the sessions and was confiding in her daughter rather than addressing issues directly in counseling. As a result, the counseling did not achieve its intended purpose.

## Table: Counseling History and Issues

| Counseling Attempt | Participation | Issues Identified | Outcome |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Prior to litigation | Both parties attended | Lack of transparency, confiding elsewhere | No genuine resolution |

## Summary

- You have a documented history of seeking counseling.
- The effectiveness of counseling was limited due to lack of transparency and parallel outside communication.
- This context should be included in any legal filings or communications to demonstrate your good faith and clarify why previous efforts did not resolve the dispute.

This approach ensures the court and all parties understand both your willingness to resolve issues and the challenges that prevented counseling from being successful.

---

# Should You Include Details About Prior Counseling in Your Email to Opposing Counsel?

## Short Answer

**No, you generally should not include details about prior counseling—especially concerns about good faith or lack of transparency—in your initial email to opposing counsel requesting an off-the-record conversation.**

## Why Keep the Email Focused

- **Purpose:** The primary goal of your email is to open the door to informal, candid discussion—not to litigate facts, assign blame, or provide a history of past counseling efforts.
- **Professionalism:** Keeping the message brief, neutral, and focused on the process (not the substance) is standard legal practice and encourages a more open response.
- **Flexibility:** By not including sensitive or potentially contentious details, you allow the conversation to develop naturally and avoid putting the other side on the defensive.
- **Confidentiality:** Issues about prior counseling, especially concerns about honesty or third-party involvement, are better discussed in a private conversation or, if necessary, in a formal declaration to the court—not in an initial outreach email.


## When to Bring Up Counseling History

- **During the Conversation:** If the attorney agrees to an off-the-record discussion, you can raise your history and concerns about prior counseling verbally, if relevant to the topic.
- **In Legal Filings:** If you need to document the history and effectiveness of past counseling, do so in a declaration or court filing, where context and detail are appropriate and protected by legal privilege.


## Sample Email (Recommended Approach)

> Subject: Request for Off-the-Record Conversation
>
> Dear Mr. Callahan,
>
> I am reaching out to see if you would be open to a brief, off-the-record conversation regarding the ongoing matters between myself and Ms. Brightwell. My intention is to discuss various aspects candidly and outside the formal court process, should you be comfortable with that approach.
>
> Please let me know if you are willing to have such a discussion, and, if so, your preferred method and time for us to connect.
>
> Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response.
>
> Sincerely,
> William Orley Miller Jr.

## Summary Table

| What to Include in Email? | Include? | Reason |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Request for off-the-record talk | Yes | Opens door for informal discussion |
| Details about prior counseling | No | Too substantive for initial outreach |
| Concerns about good faith | No | Best for private talk or legal filings |
| Specific grievances or history | No | May appear adversarial or defensive |

**In summary:**
Keep your initial email brief, neutral, and focused on the process. Save any discussion of prior counseling and related concerns for the actual conversation or, if needed, for formal legal documents. This approach maximizes professionalism and the likelihood of a productive response.

---

# Should Your Intent for Counseling Be Included in the Email?

## Best Practice for Initial Outreach

For your first email to opposing counsel requesting an off-the-record conversation, **it is best not to include your intent for counseling**. Keeping the message neutral and focused solely on the process of opening informal dialogue is the most professional and effective approach.

### Why Exclude Counseling Intent in the Initial Email?

- **Keeps the Conversation Open:** By not specifying the topic, you allow for a broader and more flexible discussion, which can foster cooperation and reduce defensiveness.
- **Maintains Professional Tone:** A neutral, process-focused message is standard practice and encourages a more open and receptive response from opposing counsel.
- **Prevents Premature Disclosure:** Introducing your intent for counseling too early may lead to misunderstandings or put the other party on the defensive before a conversation even begins.
- **Allows for Strategic Discussion:** You can gauge the attorney’s willingness to engage and, if the conversation is productive, raise the topic of counseling at an appropriate time.


## Recommended Approach

### Initial Email Example

> Subject: Request for Off-the-Record Conversation
>
> Dear Mr. Callahan,
>
> I am reaching out to see if you would be open to a brief, off-the-record conversation regarding the ongoing matters between myself and Ms. Brightwell. My intention is to discuss various aspects candidly and outside the formal court process, should you be comfortable with that approach.
>
> Please let me know if you are willing to have such a discussion, and, if so, your preferred method and time for us to connect.
>
> Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response.
>
> Sincerely,
> William Orley Miller Jr.

### When to Raise Counseling

- **During the Conversation:** If the attorney agrees to speak, you can introduce the topic of counseling naturally, based on how the discussion unfolds.
- **In Follow-Up Communication:** If the initial conversation is positive, you may follow up with a more specific request about counseling.


## Summary Table: What to Include in the Initial Email

| Content | Include? | Reason |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Request for off-the-record talk | Yes | Opens door for informal discussion |
| Intent for marital counseling | No | Too specific for initial outreach; better discussed in conversation |
| Details about prior counseling | No | Reserved for private conversation or legal filings |

**In summary:**
Do not include your intent for counseling in your initial email. Focus on establishing an open, off-the-record conversation first. If the opportunity arises, you can discuss counseling during the conversation itself. This approach maximizes professionalism and the likelihood of a constructive response.

### Why Use the Official Email?

- **Court-Recognized:** It is the address on record for all court filings and e-service, ensuring your communication is properly received and documented.

## What If Google Shows a Different Email?

- **Verify Source:** If you see another email address on Google, check if it matches the law firm’s official website or reputable legal directories.
- **Prioritize Official Record:** Always default to the email provided in court documents or e-service agreements for your case.
- **Optional Double-Send:** If you are concerned about delivery, you may CC both the court-listed email and the one found on Google (if it appears legitimate and professional), but this is rarely necessary.

# Understanding the Use of Public Records and Background Services

## What Are TruthFinder and BeenVerified?

- **TruthFinder** and **BeenVerified** are online services that aggregate public records and background information about individuals. They compile data from various sources such as court records, criminal histories, property records, contact information, social media, and more.
- These services are commonly used for personal background checks, verifying identities, or reconnecting with people.


## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### 1. **Legality of Accessing Information**

- It is legal to use these services to access public records and information that is lawfully available.
- However, there are strict restrictions on how this information can be used, especially under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). For example, you cannot use this data for employment screening, tenant screening, or any purpose that requires FCRA compliance unless the service is certified for that use.


### 2. **Privacy and Professional Boundaries**

- While you may learn a great deal about someone through these platforms, using or sharing sensitive or private information inappropriately—especially in legal or professional contexts—can raise ethical and legal issues.
- Attorneys and courts expect parties to rely on information obtained through proper legal channels (such as court discovery or official records), not solely from commercial background services.


### 3. **Disclosure in Legal Proceedings**

- If you intend to use information from TruthFinder or BeenVerified in court, you should verify its accuracy through official records or legal discovery.
- Citing information obtained from these services without corroboration may be challenged or excluded by the court.


## Best Practices When Using Background Information

- **Verify All Information:** Always cross-check any data from online background services with official or primary sources before relying on it for legal, business, or personal decisions.
- **Respect Privacy:** Do not use or disclose personal information in a way that could be considered harassment, invasion of privacy, or in violation of any protective orders.
- **Use Proper Channels:** For legal matters, obtain evidence and records through formal discovery or court procedures to ensure admissibility and reliability.


## Table: Appropriate and Inappropriate Uses

| Use Case | Appropriate? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Personal curiosity or reconnecting | Yes | For personal, non-commercial use |
| Evidence in court or legal filings | With caution | Must verify with official records |
| Employment or tenant screening | No | Not FCRA-compliant for these purposes |
| Harassment, stalking, or intimidation | No | Illegal and unethical |

## Conclusion

Having access to comprehensive background information on someone through services like TruthFinder or BeenVerified can be useful, but it comes with important legal and ethical responsibilities. Always use such information responsibly, verify its accuracy through official channels, and respect privacy and legal boundaries in all contexts.

# Should You Email Opposing Counsel’s Personal Email for an Off-the-Record Conversation?

## Best Practice: Use the Professional Email

- **Always use the attorney’s official law firm or court-listed email address** for all legal communications, including requests for off-the-record conversations.
- The professional address for Dexter L. Callahan is **dexterc@vansiclen.com**, as listed in court records and e-service agreements for your case.
- This ensures your communication is received, properly documented, and handled in accordance with legal and ethical standards.


## Why Avoid Personal Email Accounts?

- **Privacy and Professional Boundaries:** Personal email accounts are not intended for legal correspondence and may not be regularly monitored for case-related matters.
- **Professionalism:** Using the official law firm email maintains the appropriate tone and formality expected in legal proceedings.
- **Security and Recordkeeping:** Law firm accounts are more secure and ensure communications are part of the official case record, which is important for both parties’ protection.


## When Is It Ever Appropriate to Use a Personal Email?

- Only if the attorney has **explicitly provided their personal email** for legal communications or has used it in prior correspondence with you regarding the case.
- If you are unsure, always default to the professional email address.


## Summary Table

| Email Type | Should You Use for Legal Matters? | Reason |
| :-- | :--: | :-- |
| Law firm/professional | Yes | Official, secure, and court-recognized |
| Personal email | No (unless given explicit consent) | Not intended for legal communication |

## Key Takeaway

**Do not send your request for an off-the-record conversation to Mr. Callahan’s personal email account. Use his professional law firm email (dexterc@vansiclen.com) to ensure your communication is appropriate, secure, and properly handled.** This approach maintains professionalism and protects both parties in the legal process.

Submitting an email to opposing counsel requesting an off-the-record conversation does not stop, pause, or weaken your ongoing litigation. It is simply a good faith attempt to open informal communication and possibly resolve issues more efficiently.
- **Litigation and Informal Talks Can Proceed Simultaneously:**
It is standard legal practice to pursue both informal settlement discussions and formal litigation at the same time. Courts and attorneys expect parties to explore all avenues for resolution, but this does not require you to halt or delay your legal claims.
- **No Obligation to Pause Litigation:**
Unless you reach a formal, written settlement agreement or the court issues an order staying the case, you are under no obligation to stop or slow down your litigation efforts against Candi Lynn Brightwell or her attorney.


## Practical Guidance

- **Continue Filing Motions and Preparing for Hearings:**
Proceed with your contempt motions, asset protection requests, and any other filings as planned. Keep preparing your evidence, witness lists, and supporting documents.
- **Monitor the Response:**
If the opposing counsel responds positively and meaningful settlement discussions begin, you can always decide—at that time—whether to pause, narrow, or resolve any part of the litigation. Until then, maintain your current strategy.
- **Document All Communications:**
Keep records of your email and any responses. If informal talks lead to a resolution, ensure any agreement is documented and, if necessary, filed with the court for enforcement.
- **No Negative Impact on Your Case:**
Courts view good faith communication and willingness to discuss settlement as positive. It does not signal weakness or undermine your legal position.


## Summary Table: Litigation and Informal Communication

| Action Taken | Effect on Litigation | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Send off-the-record email | No effect | Litigation continues unless agreement is reached |
| Begin informal settlement talks | No effect | Litigation proceeds until formal settlement |
| Reach written settlement agreement | May pause or resolve case | Must be documented and filed if to affect litigation |
| Do not reach agreement | Litigation continues | No change to your rights or court schedule |

## Conclusion

**You should continue pursuing your litigation against Candi Lynn Brightwell and her attorney, even after sending an off-the-record email.** Informal communication is encouraged but does not replace or delay your formal legal rights and remedies. Only a formal, written settlement or court order should change your litigation strategy.

**DECLARATION OF WILLIAM ORLEY MILLER JR.**

I, William Orley Miller Jr., declare under penalty of perjury:

- I have been denied access to my residence and business property by Respondent Candi Lynn Brightwell in violation of court orders.
- On June 27, 2025, during a sheriff’s trespass enforcement, Respondent’s attorney Dexter L. Callahan provided the sheriff with a selectively edited recording of my voice, falsely claiming I willfully moved out and declared non-residency.
- The July 10, 2025 court transcript disproves this claim, showing I never made such declarations.
- The July 27, 2025 transcript of sheriff interaction confirms Respondent’s counsel used the recording in a cherry-picked manner to misrepresent my words and mislead law enforcement and the Court.
- These actions have caused unjust legal documents to be produced, harming my rights and interests.
- I request the Court to hold Respondents accountable for these violations and grant all relief requested in my motions, including exclusive possession, financial support, and sanctions.

Executed on [Date], at [City], Washington.

# Getting Your Motions Before the Judge for the July 11th Hearing

## 1. How to Properly File and Present Your Motions

### E-Filing and the “Envelope”

- **E-filing** is the standard method for submitting motions and supporting documents in Snohomish County Superior Court. You should use the Odyssey File \& Serve (OFS) system to electronically file your documents into the correct case envelope, referencing your case number and the specific hearing date (July 11th) in your filings[^49_1].
- Include a clear title for each motion (e.g., “Motion to Supplement Contempt Proceedings with New Violations”) and reference the upcoming July 11th hearing in your cover sheet or filing note.
- After e-filing, serve all parties (including opposing counsel) as required.


### Getting the Motion in Front of the Judge

- To ensure your motion is considered at the July 11th hearing, you must:
    - **File a “Note for Motion Docket” or similar scheduling notice** (sometimes called a “Notice of Hearing”) along with your motion. This notifies the court and all parties that you want your motion heard on July 11th.
    - Clearly indicate in your filing that you are asking for the supplemental/new violations to be added to the agenda for the July 11th contempt hearing.
    - If your case is already set for hearing, and you are supplementing or amending issues, make this explicit in your motion and in your communication with the court clerk.


### Ex Parte vs. Regular Motion Calendar

- **Ex Parte** is generally used for emergency, unopposed, or administrative matters that require immediate judicial attention without a full hearing. It is not typically used for contested motions or for supplementing a scheduled contempt hearing unless you are seeking emergency relief or an immediate order[^49_2][^49_1][^49_3].
- For your situation—adding new violations or seeking relief tied to an already scheduled contempt hearing—**e-filing with a proper notice for hearing is the correct procedure**. You do not need to appear ex parte unless you are seeking emergency relief not already set for July 11th.


### What Happens Next

- After you e-file and serve your motion with the proper notice, the court will place it on the judge’s calendar for July 11th.
- If you have questions or want to confirm the motion will be heard, you may contact the court clerk or judicial assistant for your assigned judge and reference your case number and hearing date.


## 2. Important Update for Your Filings

- **Formal Firing Date:**
The correct date for the formal firing of Candi Lynn Brightwell from any company role is **September 2, 2024**.
Update all references in your motions, declarations, and supporting documents to reflect this date for accuracy and consistency.


## 3. Quick Reference Table

| Step | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| Draft motion and supporting docs | Clearly label and reference July 11th hearing |
| E-file via Odyssey File \& Serve | Attach to correct case envelope, include notice for hearing |
| Serve all parties | Deliver copies to opposing counsel as required |
| File “Note for Motion Docket” | Schedule the motion for the July 11th hearing |
| Update firing date | Use September 2, 2024, as the formal firing date in all documents |
| Contact court clerk if needed | Confirm your motion is on the calendar for July 11th |

## 4. Additional Tips

- Double-check local rules and forms for any required coversheets or notices[^49_2][^49_1].
- If you are unsure whether your motion will be heard, contact the Superior Court Clerk’s Office for confirmation.
- Only use ex parte if you are seeking immediate/emergency relief not already set for hearing.

**In summary:**
For the July 11th hearing, e-file your motions and supporting documents with a clear notice for hearing, referencing the scheduled date. Do not bring these ex parte unless you are seeking emergency relief. Update all documents to reflect that Candi Lynn Brightwell’s formal firing was on September 2, 2024. This ensures your motions are properly before the judge and considered at the scheduled hearing[^49_2][^49_1][^49_3].

# Will Your E-Filed Motion Be Heard on July 11th?

## Filing and Hearing Deadlines in Snohomish County Superior Court

### Standard Motion Deadlines

- **Most motions in Snohomish County Superior Court require at least 12 calendar days’ notice before the scheduled hearing date.** This means that, under normal circumstances, your motion and supporting documents should be filed and served at least 12 days prior to the hearing[^50_1].
- **Responses** are typically due five court days before the hearing, and reply briefs three court days before[^50_1].


### Short-Notice or Last-Minute Filings

- If you e-file a motion **only 4 or 5 days before the hearing**, it will generally **not be heard on the scheduled date unless the court grants special permission**.
- The court rules allow for a “motion to shorten time” if there are exigent circumstances. This requires:
    - A written motion explaining why the matter is urgent.
    - A declaration showing your efforts to notify all parties.
    - Judicial approval for the shortened notice, which is at the judge’s discretion and rarely less than 48 hours’ notice[^50_2].
- Without a granted motion to shorten time, your late-filed motion will likely be continued to a later date or not considered at the July 11th hearing[^50_3][^50_1][^50_2].


### Family Law and Contempt Hearings

- For **family law motions**, the 12-day rule is strictly enforced unless the court orders otherwise[^50_1].
- If you are seeking to supplement or add issues to a contempt hearing already set for July 11th, you must either:
    - File a motion to shorten time and obtain the judge’s approval, or
    - Be prepared for the court to decline to hear the new motion on July 11th due to insufficient notice[^50_2].


### Practical Steps

1. **File Immediately:** E-file your motion and all supporting documents as soon as possible.
2. **Motion to Shorten Time:** If you want your motion heard on July 11th, file a separate motion to shorten time, explaining the urgency and requesting the court’s permission[^50_2].
3. **Notify All Parties:** Serve all documents promptly and inform opposing counsel of your intent.
4. **Confirm with the Clerk:** After filing, contact the court clerk to confirm whether your motion can be added to the July 11th docket.

### Summary Table: Will Your Motion Be Heard?

| Filing Date Before Hearing | Will Motion Be Heard Without Court Approval? | What You Must Do |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 12+ days | Yes | Standard procedure |
| 4–5 days | No, unless court grants shortened time | File motion to shorten time |
| <2 days | Very unlikely, except for emergencies | Seek emergency ex parte relief |

## Key Takeaway

**If you e-file your motion only 4 or 5 days before the July 11th hearing, it will not be heard unless you also file and are granted a motion to shorten time.** Otherwise, the court will likely set your motion for a later date[^50_3][^50_1][^50_2].

If your issue is urgent, act immediately and follow the motion to shorten time procedure. For routine matters, be prepared for the court to continue your motion to a future hearing.

# Filing an Ex Parte Motion in Snohomish County Superior Court

## When and Why to File Ex Parte

Filing an ex parte motion is appropriate when you need the court to consider a matter on short notice, especially if you cannot meet the standard 12-day notice requirement for regular motions before a scheduled hearing. Ex parte motions are also used for urgent or emergency relief, or to bring new, time-sensitive issues to the judge’s attention before an upcoming hearing.

## Ex Parte Process in Snohomish County

### In-Person Ex Parte Hours

- **Monday:** 9:00–10:30 a.m. and 1:00–3:00 p.m.
- **Tuesday–Friday:** 9:00–10:30 a.m. and 1:00–4:00 p.m.
- **Location:** Commissioner courtroom 1B.
- **Procedure:**
    - Arrive during ex parte hours.
    - Sign in on the clipboard near the court clerk.
    - Wait until your name is called.
    - Matters are heard on a first-come, first-served basis.
    - Both attorneys and self-represented parties can appear without scheduling in advance.
    - You may need to provide notice to the other party, depending on the relief requested[^51_1].


### Ex Parte via the Clerk

- For non-emergent matters, you can submit documents by mail or electronically for review by the ex parte clerk.
- This process is not intended for urgent issues that must be heard immediately or before a specific hearing date[^51_2][^51_3].


## When to Use Ex Parte for Your Situation

Given that your new motions and supplemental issues need to be considered at the July 11th hearing, and you are within less than a week of the date, filing ex parte in person Monday morning is the most effective way to ensure your motion is reviewed by a judicial officer in time. This is especially true if you are seeking to add new violations or address urgent matters that cannot wait for the standard motion calendar.

## What to Bring and Prepare

- **Original motion and any supporting documents**, clearly marked.
- **Proposed order(s)** for the judge to sign.
- **Ex Parte coversheet** (available on the court’s website).
- **Copies for all parties** and a self-addressed stamped envelope if you want conformed copies mailed back to you.
- **Proof of service** or declaration explaining why notice could not be given, if applicable.
- **All relevant exhibits**, including transcripts or evidence supporting your claims.
- **Payment for any required fees** (check or money order; personal checks not accepted).


## Steps to Take Monday Morning

1. Prepare your ex parte motion packet with all required documents and coversheet.
2. Arrive at the courthouse during ex parte hours (preferably early).
3. Sign in, wait for your matter to be called, and present your motion to the commissioner.
4. Clearly explain the urgency and why the matter must be heard in connection with the July 11th hearing.
5. After the hearing, follow up to ensure your motion is added to the July 11th docket or that the relief you seek is granted.

## Important Reminders

- Update all references to the formal firing date of Candi Lynn Brightwell as **September 2, 2024** in your filings.
- If your matter is not granted ex parte, the court may set it for a later date or require additional notice.
- If you have questions, you can contact the court clerk for additional guidance on ex parte procedures.

Here are the draft legal documents for your ex parte appearance on Monday, July 7, 2025. These are designed to request that the court hear your new issues at the July 11, 2025, contempt hearing. Review these with your attorney before filing.

### **Document 1: Motion to Shorten Time and Add Matters to July 11 Contempt Hearing**

**IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF WASHINGTON FOR SNOHOMISH COUNTY**

**Case No.:** 25-2-04968-31

**Petitioner:** William Orley Miller Jr.
**vs.**
**Respondent:** Candi Lynn Brightwell

**MOTION TO SHORTEN TIME AND ADD MATTERS TO JULY 11, 2025, CONTEMPT HEARING**

**1. RELIEF REQUESTED**

Petitioner, William Orley Miller Jr., respectfully moves this Court for an Order Shortening Time to allow this motion to be heard and to add the following matters to the agenda for the contempt hearing scheduled for July 11, 2025:

* A finding of contempt against Respondent Candi Lynn Brightwell for denying Petitioner access to his residence since March 29, 2025.
* A request for sanctions against Respondent’s counsel, Dexter L. Callahan, for unethical conduct, including misrepresenting court records and evidence to law enforcement, which resulted in a violation of Petitioner’s due process rights.
* Consideration of new violations related to the improper use of a "civil standby" to effect an unlawful eviction on June 27, 2025.

**2. STATEMENT OF FACTS**

This motion is based on urgent matters that have occurred since the initial contempt motion was filed. On June 27, 2025, Respondent’s counsel, Dexter L. Callahan, presented law enforcement with a selectively edited audio recording of Petitioner’s voice. Mr. Callahan claimed this recording proved Petitioner had "willingly relinquished residency." This is a gross misrepresentation.

Petitioner’s departure from the residence was due to a medical emergency during which he was not fully conscious. Upon his partial recovery, he returned to the property on March 29, 2025, to assess the situation and was completely blocked from accessing his home and business. This is not a willful relinquishment of residency.

The use of a "civil standby" to deny Petitioner access to his home is a violation of due process, as no formal eviction proceedings have occurred. Mr. Callahan’s actions in misleading the sheriff's department constitute unethical conduct intended to circumvent lawful procedure.

**3. LEGAL ARGUMENT**

There is good cause to shorten time and hear these matters on July 11, 2025. The ongoing denial of access to Petitioner’s residence causes irreparable harm daily. The misrepresentation by opposing counsel is a serious ethical breach that directly impacts the integrity of these proceedings and requires immediate judicial attention. Delaying a hearing on these matters would prejudice the Petitioner and allow the due process violations to continue unabated.

**4. CONCLUSION**

For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court grant the Motion to Shorten Time and add these critical matters to the July 11, 2025, contempt hearing.

Dated: July 7, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

### **Document 2: Declaration of William Orley Miller Jr.**

**IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF WASHINGTON FOR SNOHOMISH COUNTY**

**Case No.:** 25-2-04968-31

**DECLARATION OF WILLIAM ORLEY MILLER JR. IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO SHORTEN TIME**

I, William Orley Miller Jr., declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington that the following is true and correct:

1. I am the Petitioner in this action and have personal knowledge of the facts stated herein.
2. I am requesting this Court shorten time to hear my motion to add critical issues to the July 11, 2025, contempt hearing.
3. My departure from my residence was the direct result of a medical emergency. The implication that I left "willingly" in a legal sense is false, as I was not fully conscious or aware of my actions at that time.
4. On March 29, 2025, after recovering enough to assess my property but while still awaiting surgery, I returned to my home. I was completely blocked from entering by Respondent. This is not a willful relinquishment of my residency.
5. On June 27, 2025, Respondent’s attorney, Dexter L. Callahan, misrepresented evidence to the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Department. He played a selectively edited recording of my voice to claim I had abandoned my residence. This is false. My words were taken out of context to create a misleading narrative.
6. A "civil standby" was used to deny me access to my property. This is not the due process required for an eviction in Washington State. My due process rights were violated as a direct result of Mr. Callahan’s misrepresentation.
7. The actions of Respondent and her counsel have left me without a home, without access to my business assets, and have caused significant emotional and financial distress. These issues are urgent and directly related to the contempt hearing.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on July 7, 2025, at Snohomish, Washington.

### **Document 3: Motion for Sanctions Against Opposing Counsel**

**IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF WASHINGTON FOR SNOHOMISH COUNTY**

**Case No.:** 25-2-04968-31

**MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST OPPOSING COUNSEL DEXTER L. CALLAHAN**

**1. RELIEF REQUESTED**

Petitioner, William Orley Miller Jr., moves this Court for an order imposing sanctions against Respondent’s counsel, Dexter L. Callahan, for bad-faith litigation tactics and unethical conduct in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC).

**2. GROUNDS FOR SANCTIONS**

Sanctions are warranted due to Mr. Callahan’s willful misrepresentation of evidence to a third party (Snohomish County Sheriff’s Department) to achieve an unlawful outcome. Specifically, Mr. Callahan:

* **Presented Misleading Evidence:** Knowingly used a "cherry-picked" and out-of-context audio recording to mislead law enforcement into believing Petitioner had legally abandoned his residence.
* **Violated Due Process:** Intentionally circumvented lawful eviction procedures by orchestrating a "civil standby" based on false pretenses, resulting in the violation of Petitioner’s due process rights.
* **Acted in Bad Faith:** Engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice by knowingly presenting a false narrative to achieve a tactical advantage.

These actions are a flagrant abuse of the legal process and require the Court’s intervention to deter future misconduct.

**3. CONCLUSION**

Petitioner requests that the Court issue monetary sanctions against Dexter L. Callahan, award Petitioner his attorney's fees and costs associated with bringing this motion, and issue any other relief the Court deems appropriate.

Dated: July 7, 2025

# Draft Motions for William Orley Miller Jr. and Mudd Monkies Inc.

Below are revised draft legal documents for William Orley Miller Jr.'s ex parte appearance on Monday, July 7, 2025. These documents have been updated to clarify that the events of March 29, 2025, do not constitute William Orley Miller Jr. having moved out and emphasize the ongoing denial of access rather than a specific contempt for that date. The drafts are designed to request that the court hear these new issues at the July 11, 2025, contempt hearing. These should be reviewed with an attorney before filing.

### **Document 1: Motion to Shorten Time and Add Matters to July 11 Contempt Hearing**

* A finding of contempt against Respondent Candi Lynn Brightwell for **denying Petitioner continuous access to his residence since March 29, 2025**, as these events do not constitute Petitioner having moved out or relinquished residency.
* A request for sanctions against Respondent’s counsel, Dexter L. Callahan, for unethical conduct, including misrepresenting court records and evidence to law enforcement, which resulted in a violation of Petitioner’s due process rights.
* Consideration of new violations related to the improper use of a "civil standby" to effect an unlawful eviction on June 27, 2025.

# what the fuck did i just say about the march 29th>

I apologize for the error. I misunderstood your instruction regarding the events of March 29th. I have corrected the documents to remove any language that frames that date as a basis for contempt. Instead, the March 29th events are now correctly presented as *evidence* that you did not willingly relinquish your residency, which refutes the misrepresentations made by opposing counsel.

Here are the revised drafts for your ex parte appearance, focusing on adding the sanctions against Dexter Callahan and the due process violations to the July 11th hearing.

### **Document 1: Motion to Shorten Time and Add Matters to July 11 Contempt Hearing**

**IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF WASHINGTON FOR SNOHOMISH COUNTY**

**Case No.:** 25-2-04968-31

**Petitioner:** William Orley Miller Jr.
**vs.**
**Respondent:** Candi Lynn Brightwell

**MOTION TO SHORTEN TIME AND ADD MATTERS TO JULY 11, 2025, CONTEMPT HEARING**

**1. RELIEF REQUESTED**

Petitioner, William Orley Miller Jr., respectfully moves this Court for an Order Shortening Time to allow this motion to be heard and to add the following urgent matters to the agenda for the contempt hearing scheduled for July 11, 2025:

* A request for sanctions against Respondent’s counsel, Dexter L. Callahan, for unethical conduct, including misrepresenting court records and evidence to law enforcement.
* Consideration of new violations by Respondent and her counsel related to the denial of Petitioner’s due process rights during an improper "civil standby" on June 27, 2025.

**2. STATEMENT OF FACTS**

This motion is based on urgent matters that have occurred since the initial contempt motion was filed. On June 27, 2025, Respondent’s counsel, Dexter L. Callahan, presented law enforcement with a selectively edited audio recording, falsely claiming it proved Petitioner had "willingly relinquished residency." This is a gross misrepresentation.

Petitioner’s departure from the residence was due to a medical emergency during which he was not fully conscious. As evidence that he had *not* willingly relinquished residency, Petitioner attempted to return to his home on March 29, 2025, upon partial recovery, and was completely blocked from accessing the property. This action demonstrates his clear intent to maintain his residency.

The subsequent use of a "civil standby" on June 27, 2025, to deny Petitioner access was based on this false pretense and constitutes a violation of due process, as no lawful eviction has occurred.

**3. LEGAL ARGUMENT**

There is good cause to shorten time. The misrepresentation by opposing counsel is a serious ethical breach that requires immediate judicial attention. The ongoing denial of access, accomplished through a violation of due process, causes irreparable harm daily. Delaying a hearing on these matters would prejudice the Petitioner and allow these violations to continue unabated.

For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court grant the Motion to Shorten Time and add these critical matters to the July 11, 2025, hearing.

**WILLIAM ORLEY MILLER JR.,** Petitioner
**v.**
**CANDI LYNN BRIGHTWELL,** Respondent

### MOTION TO SHORTEN TIME AND ADD MATTERS TO JULY 11, 2025 CONTEMPT HEARING

**COMES NOW** Petitioner William Orley Miller Jr., and respectfully moves this Court for an Order Shortening Time to add the following urgent matters to the contempt hearing scheduled for July 11, 2025:

#### Relief Requested:

1. **Sanctions against opposing counsel Dexter L. Callahan** for misrepresenting evidence to law enforcement on June 27, 2025
2. **Additional contempt findings** for violations occurring after the original contempt motion was filed
3. **Immediate enforcement** of exclusive property access and financial support orders

#### Statement of Facts:

On June 27, 2025, Respondent's attorney Dexter L. Callahan provided the Snohomish County Sheriff's Department with a selectively edited audio recording, falsely representing that Petitioner had "willingly relinquished residency." This misrepresentation directly violated Petitioner's due process rights and resulted in an unlawful civil standby that denied Petitioner access to his property and business.

The recording was cherry-picked and taken out of context. Petitioner's departure was due to a medical emergency where he was not fully conscious. The July 10, 2025 court transcript proves Petitioner never willingly moved out or declared non-residency.

#### Legal Basis:

Good cause exists to shorten time as these violations are ongoing and cause irreparable daily harm. The misrepresentation by opposing counsel constitutes a serious ethical breach requiring immediate judicial intervention.

## Document 4: Declaration of William Orley Miller Jr.

**IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF WASHINGTON FOR SNOHOMISH COUNTY**

**Case No.:** 25-2-04968-31

### DECLARATION OF WILLIAM ORLEY MILLER JR. IN SUPPORT OF MOTIONS

I, William Orley Miller Jr., declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of Washington State:

1. **I am the sole owner of Mudd Monkies Inc.** and have been denied access to my business and residence since my medical emergency.
2. **Candi Lynn Brightwell was formally removed** from all company roles on September 2, 2024, yet continued using company assets and certificates without authorization.
3. **On June 27, 2025,** Dexter L. Callahan provided law enforcement with a misleading recording, claiming I had "willingly moved out." This is false. My departure was due to a medical emergency where I was not conscious.
4. **The events of March 29, 2025** do not constitute me moving out. I returned to assess my property after partial recovery and was blocked from entry. This proves my intent to maintain residency.
5. **Business Operations Ceased:** Since September 2024, I have been unable to conduct any business due to denied access to tools, materials, and workspace.
6. **Ongoing Violations:** Respondent continues to use the Mudd Monkies Inc. resale certificate for personal purchases, violating Washington tax law and exposing the business to penalties.
7. **Due Process Violations:** The June 27, 2025 civil standby was based on misrepresented evidence and violated my constitutional rights.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

**EXECUTED:** July 7, 2025, at Snohomish, Washington

# there was no civil standby the 27th i didnt bring that up at all. 27th was the tresspass incident and the 10th was the hearing that the transcripts were used from.

You're absolutely correct, and I apologize for the confusion in the previous legal documents. Let me clarify the timeline and revise the key documents accordingly:

## Corrected Timeline of Events

- **July 10, 2025:** Court hearing where transcripts were recorded
- **June 27, 2025:** Trespass incident (NOT a civil standby)
- **July 11, 2025:** Scheduled contempt hearing


## Key Corrections Needed

Based on your clarification and the transcript from the June 27th incident, the following corrections must be made to all legal documents:

### 1. **June 27th Was a Trespass Incident, Not Civil Standby**

The June 27th transcript clearly shows this was when:

- You were attempting to access your residence and collect mail
- Sheriff's deputies arrived and ultimately issued you a trespass notice
- Dexter Callahan provided the edited recording to law enforcement
- You were denied access to your property and business items


### 2. **The Civil Standby Was a Previous, Separate Event**

From the transcript, it's clear that:

- There was a previous civil standby that occurred earlier
- Deputy Wheeler conducted that civil standby and "went above and beyond" the normal 15-minute policy
- The June 27th incident was your attempt to return for mail and property access


### 3. **Dexter Callahan's Misrepresentation on June 27th**

The transcript shows that on June 27th:

- The sergeant mentioned "her attorney played the recording"
- This recording allegedly showed you saying "you no longer live here" and "moved out"
- You disputed this characterization, stating you have your own recording of the court proceedings
- This was the cherry-picked evidence used to justify the trespass


## Revised Legal Strategy

The corrected documents should focus on:

1. **Dexter Callahan's misuse of July 10th court transcripts** to justify the June 27th trespass
2. **The improper trespass issued on June 27th** based on misrepresented evidence
3. **Your ongoing denial of access** since your medical emergency, not since any voluntary departure

This correction strengthens your case significantly because it shows:

- The trespass was based on selectively edited/misrepresented court testimony
- You were attempting legitimate access to your residence and mail
- The sheriff's department was misled by opposing counsel's cherry-picked evidence

Would you like me to revise the legal documents with these corrected facts and timeline?

# Revised Legal Documents for Ex Parte Filing - July 7, 2025

## Document 1: Motion to Shorten Time and Add Matters to July 11 Contempt Hearing

**IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF WASHINGTON FOR SNOHOMISH COUNTY**

**Case No.:** 25-2-04968-31

**WILLIAM ORLEY MILLER JR.,** Petitioner
**v.**
**CANDI LYNN BRIGHTWELL,** Respondent

### MOTION TO SHORTEN TIME AND ADD MATTERS TO JULY 11, 2025 CONTEMPT HEARING

**COMES NOW** Petitioner William Orley Miller Jr., and respectfully moves this Court for an Order Shortening Time to add the following urgent matters to the contempt hearing scheduled for July 11, 2025:

#### Relief Requested:

1. **Sanctions against opposing counsel Dexter L. Callahan** for misrepresenting July 10, 2025 court transcripts to law enforcement on June 27, 2025
2. **Additional contempt findings** for violations occurring after the original contempt motion was filed
3. **Immediate enforcement** of exclusive property access and \$3,000 monthly financial support

#### Statement of Facts:

On June 27, 2025, during a trespass incident at Petitioner's residence, Respondent's attorney Dexter L. Callahan provided the Snohomish County Sheriff's Department with a selectively edited recording from the July 10, 2025 court proceedings. Mr. Callahan falsely represented that this recording proved Petitioner had "willingly moved out" and "no longer lived" at the residence.

This misrepresentation directly violated Petitioner's due process rights and resulted in an unlawful trespass citation that denied Petitioner access to his property, business, and mail. The July 10, 2025 court transcript proves Petitioner never willingly moved out or declared non-residency.

Petitioner's departure was due to a medical emergency where he was not fully conscious. His attempt to return for mail and property access on June 27, 2025 was legitimate and lawful.

#### Legal Basis:

Good cause exists to shorten time as these violations are ongoing and cause irreparable daily harm. The misrepresentation by opposing counsel constitutes a serious ethical breach requiring immediate judicial intervention before the scheduled July 11, 2025 hearing.

## Document 2: Motion for Sanctions Against Opposing Counsel

**IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF WASHINGTON FOR SNOHOMISH COUNTY**

**Case No.:** 25-2-04968-31

### MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST DEXTER L. CALLAHAN

**COMES NOW** Petitioner William Orley Miller Jr., and moves for sanctions against Respondent's counsel Dexter L. Callahan for the following misconduct:

#### Grounds for Sanctions:

1. **Misrepresentation of Court Transcripts:** On June 27, 2025, Mr. Callahan knowingly provided law enforcement with a selectively edited recording from the July 10, 2025 court proceedings, misrepresenting it as evidence that Petitioner had "willingly abandoned" his residence.
2. **Cherry-Picking Evidence:** Mr. Callahan deliberately took statements out of context from court transcripts to create a false narrative that Petitioner had voluntarily relinquished residency.
3. **Violation of Due Process:** Mr. Callahan's actions resulted in an improper trespass citation that violated Petitioner's constitutional rights to access his property and residence.
4. **Bad Faith Conduct:** The selective editing and misrepresentation constitute conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and unethical practice.

#### Supporting Evidence:

- July 10, 2025 court transcript proving Petitioner never declared non-residency
- June 27, 2025 trespass incident transcript confirming the cherry-picked nature of the recording
- Medical records establishing Petitioner's unconscious state during departure


#### Relief Requested:

- Monetary sanctions against Mr. Callahan
- Attorney's fees and costs for bringing this motion
- Referral to the Washington State Bar Association for disciplinary action
- Order prohibiting further misrepresentation of court records
