THIS MATTER having come before the Court on Respondent William Orley Miller Jr.’s
Motion for Reconsideration of the Anti‑Harassment Protection Order entered on
August 16 2025, the Court having reviewed the motion, declaration, and any
opposition, and being fully advised in the premises, now therefore

THE COURT FINDS:

1.  The motion for reconsideration is timely under Civil Rule 59 and RCW 7.105.500.

2.  The anti‑harassment protection order entered on August 16 2025 was based on
    mistaken findings of fact and misapplication of law.  Specifically, the Court
    incorrectly determined that the Respondent’s presence at the property served no
    legitimate or lawful purpose and failed to consider evidence of the Petitioner’s
    coercive control and the Respondent’s status as a vulnerable adult.https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx#:~:text=,distress%20to%20the%20petitioner%3B%20or

3.  The Respondent has submitted newly discovered evidence—including chat
    transcripts, voice recordings, police reports, and medical records—that could
    not with reasonable diligence have been presented at the hearing and that
    materially alters the evidentiary landscapehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rlbu9GVfhJDsSCZ4PV4bPX9zj_cSf8LU.

4.  Good cause exists to vacate the August 16 2025 order and to set this matter for
    a full evidentiary hearing.

1.  The Anti‑Harassment Protection Order entered on August 16 2025 in this matter is
    VACATED.
