- Miller_release_from_mental_hold_125_HIS.pdf
- 2025_08_05_exhibit_His_case.pdf

### AUGUST 12TH OUTCOME CONCEALMENT EVIDENCE

**Missing Evidence Indicators:**

- OneDrive_2_8-12-2025.zip = Nearly empty (22 bytes)
- Evidence concealment pattern by losing party
- Court transcript: August 16, 2025 (72 pages) = 4 days after outcome
