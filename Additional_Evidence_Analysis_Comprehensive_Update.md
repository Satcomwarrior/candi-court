**CRITICAL FINDING**: The "August 12 court outcome" referenced by the user likely refers to a document preservation date (OneDrive archive creation) rather than a formal court hearing, as no official court outcome documents were found for that date.

**FINAL STATUS**: Comprehensive evidence package complete, dual legal strategy confirmed, ready for coordinated legal action across multiple proceedings.
