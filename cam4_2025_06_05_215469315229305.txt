06:22 PM | Beardedveteran: Dear Cam4 Support Team, 
 I'm writing to express a significant concern regarding the prolonged ID verification process on your platform. As a model contracted with Cam4, the inability to swiftly verify additional individuals on my account has directly impacted my activity and income. 
 The current verification timeline, often extending to several weeks, is considerably longer than industry standards, where similar processes are completed in minutes. This delay forces me to cancel verification requests prematurely to access my much-needed earnings, as my income is blocked until the verification process is complete. 
 This issue not only hinders my personal growth and presence on Cam4 but also, by extension, impedes the platform's overall growth and profitability. Efficient operations, including timely verification, are crucial for retaining active models and ensuring a healthy ecosystem for all. 
 Furthermore, I'd like to specifically highlight how the blocked income due to delayed verification also prevents me from utilizing the "boost" feature, which costs 2.50 tokens. Since my earnings are inaccessible, I do not have access to the tokens needed for this feature. This limitation prevents me from utilizing a tool that could enhance my visibility and earning potential. 
 I kindly request that you investigate these matters with urgency. I'm committed to contributing to the success of Cam4, and I believe that addressing these operational inefficiencies will benefit both models and the platform itself. 
 Thank you for your time and attention to this critical issue.

07:04 PM | Beardedveteran: only that this isn't a new issue. this has been occurring every single time i try to verify someone. in the past when i contact the verification team, they respond with a gaslight of they are working their best at verifying people as they are submitted. so unless you have a part timer employee that is doing all of the verification process for the entire platform, i find that hard to believe. we are held to a high standard to help your business. i hold this platform at a high standard to help my business. i hope you understand where i am coming from. i appreciate your time. have a wonderful day

07:06 PM | Stacy from CAM4: Have a great day aswell
