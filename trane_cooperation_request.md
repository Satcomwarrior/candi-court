## PURPOSE OF CORRESPONDENCE

I am writing to request Trane Technologies' cooperation in resolving discrepancies regarding the Aflac group insurance policy administration. As the group policy administrator, your organization's assistance is essential in clarifying policy status and ensuring compliance with applicable employment and benefits law.

## BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

As a covered individual under the Aflac group policy administered by Trane Technologies, I have encountered significant discrepancies in policy coverage during a period of medical crisis. These discrepancies appear to involve conflicts between recorded policy effective dates and actual coverage periods, potentially affecting both ERISA compliance and employee notification requirements.

1. **Policy Effective Dates:** Conflicting information regarding policy start and termination dates that affect coverage during critical medical period
2. **Employee Notification:** Questions regarding proper notification procedures for policy changes affecting covered employees

## REGULATORY CONTEXT

This matter involves potential compliance issues under several regulatory frameworks:

### ERISA Fiduciary Obligations
- Duty to properly administer employee benefit plans
- Obligation to maintain accurate records and provide proper notifications
- Responsibility for ensuring covered employees receive entitled benefits

### Washington State Insurance Law
- RCW 48.18.290 notification requirements for policy changes
- Group policy administration standards under Washington insurance code
- Employer obligations regarding employee benefit continuity

### Employment Law Considerations
- Duty to maintain accurate employment records
- Obligation to provide proper notifications regarding benefit changes
- Protection of employee rights during medical leave or health crises

## COOPERATION TIMELINE

Given the medical nature of this situation and pending regulatory review, I respectfully request your response by **Tuesday, August 26, 2025**. This timeline will allow for proper coordination with ongoing insurance review processes and ensure timely resolution of coverage questions.

- Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (employee protection)

## PREFERRED RESOLUTION APPROACH
