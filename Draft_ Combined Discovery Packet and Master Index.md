# Draft: Combined Discovery Packet and Master Index (Snohomish County Superior Court)

Below is a structured, single “Discovery Packet” document that compiles and organizes all relevant case documents found in the file set, arranged to follow Snohomish County Superior Court practices for civil protection order/family law matters. It includes a master index, Bates-label scheme, defined discovery requests, and an attachments section referencing each item so it can be filed/served as one cohesive packet. Where useful, I embedded short, numbered citations to the underlying items so a court or opposing counsel can locate them quickly.

Note: Replace bracketed placeholders like “[BATES-0001]” and “[Exhibit A]” with final pagination once exported. File names and content summaries tie to the identified items below.
