IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF WASHINGTON
FOR SNOHOMISH COUNTY

Candi Lynn Brightwell,                              )
      Petitioner,                                   )
                                                    )   Case No. 25‑2‑04968‑31

William Orley Miller Jr.,                           )   DECLARATION OF WILLIAM
      Respondent.                                   )   ORLEY MILLER JR.
                                                    )


I, William Orley Miller Jr., declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
Washington as follows:

1.  I am the Respondent in the above‑entitled action.  I am over the age of eighteen,
    have personal knowledge of the matters herein, and am competent to testify.

2.  I served in the United States military and am a combat veteran.  As a result of my
    service, I suffer from post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety.  In
    September 2024 I underwent emergency brain surgery to address a carotid artery
    dissection.  During my recovery I struggled with mobility, cognitive impairment,
    and increased PTSD symptoms.

3.  Candi Lynn Brightwell (the Petitioner) and I cohabited at 1024 South Machias
    Road, Snohomish, Washington, where I operate my welding and fabrication
    business.  We were in a romantic relationship from 2021 until 2024.

4.  Beginning in August 2024 the Petitioner engaged in a campaign of psychological
    abuse and coercive control.  She regularly locked me out of my own home,
    withheld tools and equipment, and threatened to dispose of my property.  She
    routinely spread false allegations to neighbors and law enforcement that I was
    hacking her devices, placing cameras, or sabotaging her internet.  She refused
    mediation or counseling and instead demanded that I leave the property.

5.  In November 2024 I had brain surgery.  While I was recovering in December 2024,
    the Petitioner forced me to sleep in the unheated garage and refused to allow me
    into the residence.  When I attempted to retrieve my tools for work, she called the
    police and accused me of violence.  Police reports from December 27 2024 show
    that I was living in the garage and that I attempted suicide by hanging; the
    Petitioner removed the rope and continued to provoke me until I fledhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rlbu9GVfhJDsSCZ4PV4bPX9zj_cSf8LU.

6.  Over the next months I repeatedly apologized, sought counseling, and asked that
    we work together to divide property and separate peacefully.  The Petitioner
    refused every overture and instead filed multiple protection orders and criminal
    complaints.  She took advantage of my medical vulnerability to portray me as an
    abuser when I was in fact reacting defensively.

7.  On August 16 2025 a hearing was held on the Petitioner’s request for an
    anti‑harassment protection order.  Due to my limited resources and the
    Petitioner’s control of evidence, I could not present all relevant documents and
    recordings.  The Court found the Petitioner’s testimony “slightly more credible”
    and entered a one‑year order barring me from the property.

8.  Since that hearing I have obtained substantial additional evidence:

    a.  **Chat and text transcripts** – I recovered communications from our shared
        cloud accounts showing that the Petitioner repeatedly lied, stonewalled,
        manipulated, and baited me in order to provoke a reaction.  In messages she
        admitted to “mind games,” called me a liar while confirming the truth of my
        statements, threatened to dispose of my tools, and refused to discuss our
        relationship except to demand my departure.  I attempted to de‑escalate,
        apologized, and sought counseling; she responded with contempthttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1yzgniiCvAxyi_Qh1VIv7sDFZQFaxebOg.

    b.  **Voice recordings** – The recovered recordings capture the Petitioner
        screaming, threatening to call Child Protective Services, and admitting that
        she was withholding my property to force me to leave.  They demonstrate
        that my raised voice was reactive to her abusive conduct.

    c.  **Law‑enforcement and medical records** – Police reports from
        December 2024 document my suicidal ideation and the Petitioner’s refusal to
        let me in the househttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rlbu9GVfhJDsSCZ4PV4bPX9zj_cSf8LU.  Medical records show I was under doctor’s
        orders not to be exposed to stress or extreme temperatures.  The Petitioner’s
        actions placed my health at risk and constitute mental abuse under
        RCW 74.34.020https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sn_gQnFPY69cceTo8yMwBb35l4VGDCdk.

    d.  **Business documents** – Receipts and invoices show that I own the majority
        of the tools and equipment at the property.  The Petitioner claims that I
        returned “uninvited,” but I had a legitimate business purpose for being there.

9.  I have not committed any acts of violence since December 2024.  I have attended
    therapy, complied with all court orders, and sought assistance from Adult
    Protective Services.  The Petitioner, however, continues to send harassing
    messages to my friends and family, post defamatory statements online, and
    dispose of my property without my consent.

10. Because of the anti‑harassment order, I have been unable to access my
    residence, my business equipment, or my tools.  I am facing homelessness and
    financial ruin.  I am currently living in my vehicle and unable to generate
    income.  The Petitioner refuses to allow me to collect my personal items.

11. My conduct never constituted “unlawful harassment.”  RCW 7.105.010(36)
    requires that the course of conduct serve “no legitimate or lawful purpose.”
    Retrieving my property and protecting my business are lawful purposes.

12. The Petitioner’s actions constitute abuse of a vulnerable adult.  Under
    RCW 74.34.020 mental abuse includes “verbal assaults, threats of abuse, and
    harassment.”https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sn_gQnFPY69cceTo8yMwBb35l4VGDCdk Personal exploitation includes exerting control over
    property of a vulnerable adult by deception or undue influence.  By banning me
    from my home, withholding my tools, and manipulating the legal system, the
    Petitioner has exploited my vulnerability.

13. I respectfully request that the Court reconsider and vacate the anti‑harassment
    protection order.  In the alternative, the Court should modify the order to
    permit me to access my residence and business equipment and schedule an
    evidentiary hearing on the merits.


I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington that the
foregoing is true and correct.


DATED this 22nd day of August, 2025, in Snohomish County, Washington.
