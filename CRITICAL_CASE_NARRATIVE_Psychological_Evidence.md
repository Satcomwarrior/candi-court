**SECTION 8 SUMMARY**: Weaponized mental health tactics represent sophisticated abuse methodology where victim's psychological responses to trauma are manipulated as evidence against them. In Miller v. Brightwell, this pattern is extensively documented and serves as both evidence of abuse and foundation for damages calculation. Professional recognition of these tactics is essential for proper legal response and victim protection.
