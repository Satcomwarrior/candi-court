      Respondent.                               )   RIGHTS
________________________________________________)

I, William Orley Miller Jr., declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
Washington that the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

1. I am the Petitioner in this action.  I am competent to testify regarding the matters
stated herein.  I make this declaration in support of my motion to establish a committed
intimate relationship (CIR) with Respondent Candi Lynn Brightwell and to determine
property rights.

2. **Continuous Cohabitation.** Respondent and I began cohabiting on or about
September 1, 2018 and lived together continuously through April 2025 at 1024 S. Machias
Road, Snohomish, Washington.  We shared a bedroom, household responsibilities, and
maintained the property jointly.

3. **Duration of Relationship.** Our relationship lasted more than six years.
Recent case law holds that relationships of five or more years typically support a CIR finding.

4. **Purpose of Relationship.** We held ourselves out to the community as a
committed couple.  Respondent’s children referred to me as “dad.”  We celebrated
holidays together, attended school events, and presented ourselves as a family unit.

5. **Pooling of Resources.** We pooled our financial resources and operated our
business, Mudd Monkies Inc., from the shared property.  I paid approximately $3,200
per month toward the mortgage and utilities for over four years.  I invested more than
$180,000 in property renovations, including constructing a woodshop, installing hardwood
floors, and making structural improvements.  Our business income, approximately $160,000
per year, was used to support the household and the business.

6. **Intent of the Parties.** We intended to create a permanent partnership.
Respondent added me to her Aflac insurance policy in January 2025, reflecting our ongoing
commitment.  We referred to each other as husband and wife and planned for a future
together.  Our relationship ended in April 2025; my rental application dated February 24,
2025 listed “divorce” as the reason for leaving our shared residence, showing we viewed our
relationship as marriage‑like.

7. Based on these facts, I believe a committed intimate relationship existed between
Respondent and me, and I respectfully request that the Court so find and equitably divide
property acquired during the relationship.

I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY under the laws of the state of Washington
that the foregoing is true and correct.

Dated this _____ day of August 2025, at Snohomish, Washington.
