________________________________________________)

THIS MATTER came before the Court on Petitioner’s Motion to Establish Committed
Intimate Relationship and Determine Property Rights.  The Court, having reviewed the
motion, declaration, and supporting materials, and being fully advised, makes the following
findings and orders:

FINDINGS

1. The parties cohabited continuously at 1024 S. Machias Road, Snohomish,
Washington from on or about September 1, 2018 through April 2025.

2. The parties maintained a stable, marriage‑like relationship during that period,
sharing financial resources, operating a joint business, and holding themselves out as a
family unit.

3. The relationship lasted more than six years and meets the five factors outlined in
Connell v. Francisco, 127 Wn.2d 339 (1995) for a committed intimate relationship.  The
Court therefore finds that a committed intimate relationship existed between the parties.

4. Property acquired by either party during the relationship is presumed to be
community‑like property subject to equitable division.  The Court has authority under
RCW 26.09.080 (applied by analogy) and Connell v. Francisco to make a just and
equitable disposition of such property.

5. The parties have substantial property interests, including real property equity,
business assets of Mudd Monkies Inc., retirement accounts, and personal property, that
require inventory and valuation.  There are mutual protection orders between the parties
which complicate direct communication.

ORDERS

1. A Committed Intimate Relationship existed between Petitioner William Orley
Miller Jr. and Respondent Candi Lynn Brightwell from on or about September 1, 2018
through April 2025.

2. All property acquired by either party during that period is presumptively
community‑like property subject to equitable division.  The Court retains jurisdiction to
make a final determination of property rights and will consider the factors set forth in
RCW 26.09.080 and applicable case law.

3. To preserve property pending final division, both parties are RESTRAINED from
transferring, encumbering, concealing, or wasting any property acquired during the
relationship without further order of the Court.

4. A special master may be appointed pursuant to Civil Rule 53 to inventory
property, obtain valuations, and make recommendations for equitable distribution if the
parties are unable to agree on division.  The Court will consider appointment of a special
master upon motion or stipulation of the parties.

5. A hearing on final property division shall be scheduled after completion of
discovery and any special master report.

6. This Order is temporary and shall remain in effect until superseded by further
order of the Court or the entry of final orders resolving property division.

DATED this _____ day of _________________, 2025.
