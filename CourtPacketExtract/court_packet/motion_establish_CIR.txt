________________________________________________)

I. RELIEF REQUESTED

   Petitioner William Orley Miller Jr. moves the Court to enter an order finding that the
parties were in a committed intimate relationship (CIR) from on or about September 1, 2018
through April 2025 and to determine property rights arising from that relationship.  Petitioner
requests that the Court divide all property acquired during the relationship in a just and
equitable manner, appoint a special master if necessary to inventory assets, and restrain the
parties from disposing of or concealing property pending final division.

II. STATEMENT OF FACTS

   1. Petitioner and Respondent began cohabiting as partners on or about September 1,
2018 and lived together continuously through April 2025.  During this period they resided
at 1024 S. Machias Road, Snohomish, Washington.  They held themselves out to the
community as a committed couple and integrated their families, finances, and business
affairs.

   2. The parties pooled resources and operated a business, Mudd Monkies Inc., from
their shared residence.  Petitioner invested substantial time and money in improving the
property, including an estimated $180,000 in renovations and $3,200 in monthly housing
costs over several years.  Respondent’s children referred to Petitioner as “dad,” and the
parties shared family vacations and celebrations.

   3. The relationship ended in April 2025, as reflected in Petitioner’s rental application
dated February 24, 2025 listing “divorce” as the reason for leaving the shared residence.

   4. Petitioner submits the accompanying declaration and evidence establishing the
five factors set forth in Connell v. Francisco, 127 Wn.2d 339 (1995): continuous
cohabitation, duration, purpose, pooling of resources, and intent.  Each factor supports the
existence of a CIR.

   5. Under Washington law, property acquired during a CIR is presumed to be
community‑like property subject to equitable division.  See Connell v. Francisco, 127 Wn.2d
339 (1995); In re Kelly & Moesslang, 170 Wn. App. 722 (2012).  Petitioner seeks an order
dividing real property equity, business assets, retirement accounts, and personal property
acquired during the relationship.

III. ARGUMENT

   1. **Existence of a CIR.** The parties cohabited for over six years, shared
financial responsibilities, pooled their resources, operated a joint business, and held
themselves out as a family.  These facts satisfy all five Connell factors.  The lengthy
cohabitation and substantial integration distinguish this case from shorter or casual
relationships.

   2. **Equitable Division of Property.** Once a CIR is established, the Court must
divide community‑like property in a just and equitable manner, analogous to RCW 26.09.080.
Petitioner invested significant funds and labor into the shared property and business and
contributed to the parties’ financial well‑being.  Equitable division requires accounting for
those contributions.

   3. **Need for Restraining Orders and Special Master.** Mutual protection orders
exist between the parties, preventing direct contact.  To preserve property and facilitate
division, temporary restraining orders and appointment of a neutral special master are
warranted.  The special master can inventory property, obtain valuations, and recommend
division.

IV. CONCLUSION

   Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order finding that a Committed
Intimate Relationship existed between the parties from September 1, 2018 through April 2025,
divide community‑like property in a just and equitable manner, restrain the parties from
wasting property, appoint a special master if necessary, and grant any other relief the Court
deems proper.

Dated this _____ day of August 2025.
