      Respondent.                               )
________________________________________________)

I, William Orley Miller Jr., declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
Washington that the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

1. I am the Petitioner in the above‑entitled matter.  I am representing myself pro se.

2. From September 2018 through April 2025, I maintained a committed intimate
relationship with Respondent Candi Lynn Brightwell.  During that time we cohabited at 1024
S. Machias Road, Snohomish, Washington and pooled our resources.  We operated our
business, Mudd Monkies Inc., from the property and shared financial responsibilities.

3. In January 2025 Respondent added me to her Aflac health insurance policy.  I relied
on this coverage for my ongoing medical needs.  At that time our relationship was ongoing and
we continued to hold ourselves out as a committed couple.

4. In March 2025, without my knowledge or consent, Respondent canceled my Aflac
health insurance coverage.  I only learned of this cancellation when I submitted a claim and
was informed by Aflac that my coverage had been terminated.  Respondent’s cancellation was
malicious and was intended to cause me financial harm.

5. I suffer from significant medical conditions, including a brain aneurysm requiring
surgery.  My neurosurgeon has scheduled surgery in the near future.  The loss of insurance
coverage places my health at risk and threatens my ability to proceed with this life‑saving
procedure.

6. Since the cancellation of my coverage I have incurred medical bills that I cannot
afford to pay.  I have attempted to obtain individual coverage but have been denied due to
pre‑existing conditions.  Without the Court’s intervention, I will be forced to postpone or
cancel my surgery and other necessary treatment.

7. I understand that automatic temporary restraining orders in dissolution and family law
cases prohibit parties from transferring property or changing insurance coverage without court
approval【494426510934795†L190-L199】.  Respondent’s cancellation violates these principles.  I am requesting the
Court to order Respondent to reinstate my insurance coverage or provide comparable
coverage at her expense and to prohibit further changes to any insurance policies covering
either party without court approval.

8. I make this declaration in support of my motion for temporary orders reinstating
insurance coverage.  I respectfully request that the Court enter the relief described in the
motion.

I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY under the laws of the state of Washington
that the foregoing is true and correct.

Dated this _____ day of August 2025, at Snohomish, Washington.
