disability.  My income consists of sporadic distributions from Mudd Monkies Inc., which is
currently non‑operational due to ongoing litigation.  My average monthly income is
approximately $1,000.

2. My monthly expenses exceed my income.  I am responsible for $3,200 per month
in housing costs, utilities, and other living expenses.  I also have significant medical
expenses and no health insurance coverage due to Respondent’s cancellation of my policy.

3. I have no savings or liquid assets.  My personal property consists of tools and
household goods.  I own no real property.  Any business assets are subject to division in this
proceeding and are not readily convertible to cash.

4. I am unable to pay the filing fee without causing substantial hardship to myself.

5. I respectfully request that the Court waive the filing fee and any surcharges
pursuant to GR 34.

I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY under the laws of the state of Washington
