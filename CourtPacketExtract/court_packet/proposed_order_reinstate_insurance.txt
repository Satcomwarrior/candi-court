________________________________________________)

THIS MATTER came before the Court on Petitioner’s Motion for Temporary Orders
Reinstating Insurance Coverage.  The Court, having considered the pleadings, declarations,
arguments of the parties, and the files and records herein, and being fully advised, makes
the following findings and orders:

FINDINGS

1. The parties are engaged in proceedings regarding their committed intimate
relationship and property division.  Automatic temporary restraining orders prohibit
canceling insurance coverage absent court approval【494426510934795†L190-L199】.

2. Respondent unilaterally canceled Petitioner’s health insurance coverage on or about
March 2025 without court approval.  Petitioner is scheduled for significant medical procedures
and requires insurance coverage for treatment.

3. Failure to reinstate Petitioner’s insurance coverage will result in immediate and
irreparable harm to Petitioner’s health and financial well‑being.

4. It is just and equitable to reinstate Petitioner’s coverage and restrain the parties
from altering insurance policies while this case is pending.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:

1. Respondent shall immediately reinstate Petitioner’s health and accident insurance
coverage under the Aflac policy under which he was insured in January 2025.  If that policy
cannot be reinstated, Respondent shall obtain and maintain equivalent health and accident
coverage for Petitioner at her expense.  Proof of reinstatement or procurement of equivalent
coverage shall be provided to Petitioner (through counsel, if represented) within five (5) days
of entry of this Order.

2. Respondent shall be responsible for any and all medical expenses incurred by
Petitioner that would have been covered under the reinstated or equivalent policy from the
date of cancellation until the policy is reinstated or replaced.

3. Both parties are RESTRAINED from canceling, altering, or changing any insurance
policy (including health, life, automobile, disability, or liability policies) covering either party
without further order of the Court.

4. This Order shall remain in effect until further order of the Court or the entry of
final orders resolving the parties’ property division and dissolution proceeding.

5. Failure to comply with this Order may result in sanctions, including contempt,
attorney fees, or other appropriate remedies.

DONE IN OPEN COURT this _____ day of _________________, 2025.
