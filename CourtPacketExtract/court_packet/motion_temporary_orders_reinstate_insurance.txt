________________________________________________)

I. RELIEF REQUESTED

   Petitioner William Orley Miller Jr. respectfully moves the Court for the entry of temporary
orders requiring Respondent Candi Lynn Brightwell to reinstate Petitioner’s health and accident
insurance coverage or, in the alternative, to provide equivalent coverage at her expense.  On
January 2025 Respondent added Petitioner to her Aflac health insurance policy while their
relationship continued.  Shortly thereafter Respondent unilaterally and maliciously canceled
Petitioner’s coverage.  Petitioner is facing significant medical procedures, including brain
surgery, and requires immediate reinstatement of coverage.  The parties’ dissolution/CIR
proceedings are pending, and Washington law prohibits a party from changing or canceling
insurance coverage during such proceedings without a court order.  Petitioner therefore seeks
temporary orders reinstating insurance coverage and preventing further cancellation or changes.

II. FACTS SUPPORTING MOTION

   1. The parties are engaged in proceedings to determine their Committed Intimate
Relationship and divide their property.  A protection order is currently in place in this case and
communication must occur through counsel or court orders.

   2. On or about January 2025, Respondent added Petitioner to her Aflac health insurance
policy.  By adding Petitioner, Respondent acknowledged the ongoing relationship and created
an expectation of coverage for medical care.

   3. In or around March 2025, without notice to Petitioner, Respondent canceled Petitioner’s
coverage.  Petitioner discovered the cancellation only after submitting a medical claim and
learning that coverage had been terminated.  Respondent’s cancellation was malicious and
intended to cause financial hardship.

   4. Petitioner suffers from serious medical conditions and is scheduled for brain surgery in
the near future.  The loss of insurance coverage jeopardizes Petitioner’s ability to obtain
necessary medical care and imposes extreme financial hardship.

   5. Automatic temporary restraining orders and the Court’s inherent equitable authority
prohibit parties in dissolution or CIR proceedings from canceling or altering insurance coverage
without court approval.  See, e.g., Washington Superior Court Family Law Local Rules and
RCW 26.09.080 (applied by analogy to committed intimate relationships).  Commentary on
temporary orders notes that courts routinely issue automatic orders prohibiting the transfer of
property and cancellation of insurance coverage while a case is pending【494426510934795†L190-L199】.  Parties
may seek court approval to modify such coverage but must do so by motion; unilateral
cancellation is not permitted【494426510934795†L190-L199】.

III. ARGUMENT

   Washington courts have authority to issue temporary orders preserving the status quo and
protecting the parties’ financial and personal interests during dissolution and CIR proceedings.
See RCW 26.09.060 and RCW 26.09.080 (granting courts broad equitable powers to make
“just and equitable” orders).  The same equitable principles apply to committed intimate
relationships under Connell v. Francisco, 127 Wn.2d 339 (1995).  Automatic temporary orders
frequently include provisions prohibiting changing or canceling insurance coverage【494426510934795†L190-L199】.  In
light of these principles, courts routinely order parties to maintain health and accident insurance
coverage for the other party and dependents while litigation is pending.

   Here, Respondent’s unilateral cancellation of Petitioner’s insurance violates the spirit of
automatic temporary restraining orders and constitutes financial misconduct.  Petitioner faces
immediate and irreparable harm in the form of uncovered medical expenses and the potential
inability to proceed with necessary brain surgery.  The Court has authority to order
Respondent to reinstate the coverage or, if reinstatement is not possible, to pay for comparable
coverage and all uninsured medical expenses incurred as a result of the cancellation.

   Temporary orders should remain in effect until the final resolution of the parties’ property
division and dissolution proceedings.  In addition, the Court should restrain Respondent from
making any further changes to insurance policies covering either party without prior court
approval.

IV. CONCLUSION

   For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter temporary
orders:

   1. Finding that Respondent wrongfully canceled Petitioner’s health insurance coverage;
   2. Ordering Respondent to immediately reinstate Petitioner’s coverage under her Aflac
policy or, if reinstatement is not possible, to obtain and maintain equivalent coverage for
Petitioner at her expense;
   3. Ordering Respondent to pay any medical bills incurred by Petitioner due to the lack of
coverage since the cancellation;
   4. Prohibiting either party from changing or canceling any insurance policy covering either
party without further order of the Court;
   5. Granting such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Dated this _____ day of August 2025.

Respectfully submitted,
