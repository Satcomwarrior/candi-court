Re: Emergency Ex Parte Motion â€“ Case No. 25-2-04968-31

Dear Honorable Court:

I respectfully submit this emergency ex parte motion for temporary orders and initiation of Committed Intimate Relationship (CIR) proceedings. This filing includes compelling evidence of Respondent's systematic disposal of shared assets through online sales during active litigation, creating irreparable harm requiring immediate court intervention.

Enclosed documents:
1. Emergency Motion for Temporary Orders and CIR Determination Hearing
2. Declaration of William Orley Miller Jr. 
3. Comprehensive Exhibit Index (Exhibits A, F, L, 1-18)
4. Motion for Fee Waiver Renewal (GR 34)
5. Supplemental Motion Regarding Prior Contempt Violations

Due to my life-threatening carotid aneurysm and ongoing financial losses exceeding $750 per day, I respectfully request immediate ex parte presentation to the duty judge.

Respectfully submitted,
