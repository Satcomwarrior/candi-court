---

## **üîç CROSS-REFERENCE WITH EXISTING EVIDENCE**

### **YOUR DOCUMENTED ABANDONMENT CLAIMS:**

#### **From Motion Analysis File:**

**ACCUSATION 12**: "Complete abandonment" - "completely AWOL and non-responsive"

- **VALIDATED**: August 16th withdrawal confirms non-responsiveness

**ACCUSATION 13**: "Only action was to STRIKE the contempt hearing"

- **SIGNIFICANT**: This represents abandonment of client interests - striking a hearing that could have provided relief shows Rongerude prioritized his own convenience over effective representation withdrawal

**ACCUSATION 14**: "Created worse legal situation"

- **COURT RECOGNITION**: Withdrawal acknowledges ineffective representation

**ACCUSATION 15**: "Late submittal caused by abandonment"

- **VINDICATION**: Court likely recognized causal connection

- **SUCCESS**: Withdrawal = first step toward new counsel appointment

   - Creating "worse legal situation" = inadequate representation

3. **RPC 1.16 - Improper Withdrawal Timing**
   - Should have withdrawn earlier when unable to represent effectively
   - Delayed withdrawal caused client harm

### **MALPRACTICE IMPLICATIONS:**

1. **Duty of care** - Court-appointed counsel owes same duty as retained counsel
2. **Causation** - Your documented "late submittal" directly caused by abandonment
3. **Damages** - Lost contempt hearing, worse legal position, pro se burden
