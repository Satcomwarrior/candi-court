Export-Csv "C:\Users\Muddm\Downloads\BUSINESS_FILES_INVENTORY.csv"
```

### PHASE 2: AUDIO/VIDEO EVIDENCE
**Target: Criminal evidence for prosecution**

Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending |
Export-Csv "C:\Users\Muddm\Downloads\MEDIA_FILES_INVENTORY.csv"
```

### PHASE 3: LEGAL DOCUMENTS
**Target: Court filings, communications**

#### Week 4: Legal Documentation
```powershell
# Search for legal files
Get-ChildItem -Path "D:\", "E:\", "F:\" -Recurse -Include "*.pdf", "*.doc*" |
Where-Object {$_.Name -match "court|filing|declaration|motion|order|case|legal|attorney"} |
