## **üîß STRATEGIC ENHANCEMENTS TO CONSIDER:**

### **SECTION V: INTEGRATION WITH CURRENT ABUSE EVIDENCE**

Add this section to connect with your harassment/abuse case:

```
**V. PATTERN OF FINANCIAL ABUSE AND INTERFERENCE**

10. **Medical Emergency Exploitation:** During my medical crisis in March 2025 
    (carotid artery dissection requiring emergency surgery), Respondent used her 
    corporate officer position to cancel my Aflac insurance coverage, leaving me 
    without medical coverage during a life-threatening emergency.

11. **Systematic Financial Abuse:** The exclusion from the Property and denial 
    of access to my business equipment represents part of a documented pattern 
    of financial abuse totaling over $580,000 in damages.

12. **Business Interference:** Respondent's actions have prevented me from 
    operating my contracting business from the Property where my tools and 
    equipment remain, causing ongoing business losses.
```

### **SECTION VI: ENHANCED RELIEF REQUESTED**

```
**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests this Court:

A. **Declare the existence of a Committed Intimate Relationship** between 
   Petitioner and Respondent from September 1, 2018 to August 24, 2024;

B. **Award Petitioner an equitable lien** against the Property in the amount 
   of $186,974 to secure his documented contributions;

C. **Order equitable distribution** of all assets acquired during the CIR, 
   including enhanced share to Petitioner based on documented abuse;

D. **Award restitution** for unjust enrichment and ongoing losses;

E. **Order return of Petitioner's business tools and equipment** currently 
   on the Property;

F. **Award attorney fees and costs** pursuant to RCW 26.09.140;
