# Opening Statement
$OpeningStatement = @"
OPENING STATEMENT - OCTOBER 10, 2025
MILLER v. BRIGHTWELL - COMMITTED INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP CASE

Your Honor,

This case presents overwhelming evidence of a 6.7-year committed intimate relationship and systematic financial abuse that has caused over one million dollars in documented damages.

THE RELATIONSHIP FOUNDATION:

For nearly seven years, from September 1, 2018 through April 2025, William Miller and Candi Brightwell lived together as a committed couple at 1024 S. Machias Road. This was not a casual relationship - it was a marriage-like partnership that created a family unit where Ms. Brightwell's children called Mr. Miller "dad."

The strength of their commitment is demonstrated by Ms. Brightwell adding Mr. Miller to her AFLAC insurance policy in January 2025, just months before the relationship ended. When they finally separated, their rental application listed "divorce" as the reason for leaving - clear evidence of how they viewed their relationship.

THE FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIP:

Your Honor, we don't present estimates or assumptions. We present bank records. Over $1,036,595 in documented financial contributions that Mr. Miller made to this relationship:

- $123,621 in verified bank account transfers and joint financial activity
- $256,000 in housing payments toward mortgage and utilities over 6.7 years  
- $180,000+ in property improvements and renovations
- $580,000+ in business development and corporate assets

These are not disputed amounts, Your Honor. These are documented by independent third-party bank records, business statements, and objective evidence.

THE LAW AND THE EVIDENCE:

Under Washington's Connell v. Francisco standard, all five factors are met with exceptional strength:

1. Cohabitation: 6.7 years of continuous living together
2. Duration: Far exceeds Washington's 5-year preference for CIR recognition
3. Pooling: Over one million dollars in documented joint financial activity
4. Intent: Insurance policy addition during the relationship shows commitment
5. Holding Out: Community recognition as a family unit for nearly seven years

THE ABUSE CAMPAIGN:

Your Honor, what makes this case particularly compelling is the documented evidence of how this relationship ended. Audio recordings capture systematic psychological abuse. Screen recordings document criminal stalking behavior. Medical privacy violations occurred during Mr. Miller's vulnerable period following brain surgery.

This is not just a property recovery case - it's a case about a systematic campaign to destroy a person's life while stealing their financial contributions.

THE REMEDY:

Mr. Miller seeks recovery of his documented contributions. Based on over one million dollars in verified financial input, a conservative 50% recovery would be $518,000. A more typical 65% recovery would be $674,000. For a case this strong, 75% recovery of $777,000 is fully justified.

Your Honor, the evidence will show that this relationship created substantial joint property through Mr. Miller's documented contributions, and justice requires that he recover a fair share of what he helped build over 6.7 years.

Thank you, Your Honor. The evidence will prove every element we've outlined today.
