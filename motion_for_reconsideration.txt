IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF WASHINGTON
FOR SNOHOMISH COUNTY

Candi Lynn Brightwell,                              )
      Petitioner,                                   )

                                                    )


               I. RELIEF REQUESTED

        Pursuant to Civil Rule 59(a), Local Civil Rule 59, and RCW 7.105.500, Respondent
William Orley Miller Jr. moves the Court to reconsider and vacate the Anti‑Harassment
Protection Order (AHPO) entered on August 16 2025.  The Respondent also requests that
the Court either dismiss the underlying petition or set the matter for a full evidentiary
hearing on the issues raised herein.


               II. STATEMENT OF FACTS

        Respondent adopts and incorporates by reference the Declaration of William Orley
Miller Jr. filed contemporaneously with this motion.  In summary, the facts show the
following:

1.  The Respondent is a disabled combat veteran who recently underwent brain surgery
    and suffers from severe post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Under RCW 74.34.020
    he qualifies as a vulnerable adulthttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1yzgniiCvAxyi_Qh1VIv7sDFZQFaxebOg.

2.  The parties shared a residence and business.  Beginning in mid‑2024, the Petitioner
    engaged in a pattern of coercive control, mental abuse, and property deprivation,
    documented in communications and law‑enforcement records.  The Petitioner
    repeatedly locked the Respondent out of his home and business, disposed of his
    tools, withheld his personal belongings, and threatened homelessness during his
    surgical recoveryhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1yzgniiCvAxyi_Qh1VIv7sDFZQFaxebOg.

3.  The Respondent sought dialogue and de‑escalation.  He apologized numerous
times, offered counseling, and documented the pattern of abuse.  The Petitioner
stonewalled, refused mediation, and weaponised the legal system to force the
Respondent from his residence and businesshttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1yzgniiCvAxyi_Qh1VIv7sDFZQFaxebOg.

4.  The Petitioner filed the AHPO alleging “unlawful harassment.”  At the hearing on
August 16 2025, the Court credited Petitioner’s claims and entered a one‑year
anti‑harassment order.

5.  Since entry of the order, the Respondent has discovered substantial new evidence
that was not reasonably available at the time of the hearing, including:

    •  Text and call transcripts showing that the Petitioner was the primary aggressor
       and repeatedly provoked the Respondent through harassment, surveillance, and
       threats, causing reactive responses.  The transcripts show the Petitioner engaged
       in a DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender) strategy and admitted
       to manipulating the Respondenthttps://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx#:~:text=,distress%20to%20the%20petitioner%3B%20or.

    •  Police reports from December 2024 documenting the Respondent’s suicidal
       ideation, the Petitioner’s control of the home and business, and the fact that the
       Respondent was banished to the garage during his medical recoveryhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rlbu9GVfhJDsSCZ4PV4bPX9zj_cSf8LU.

    •  Proof of the Respondent’s legal ownership of the property and tools, demonstrating
       that his presence at the residence served a legitimate business purpose and
       therefore cannot constitute “unlawful harassment” under RCW 7.105.010(36)
       (requiring that conduct serve no legitimate or lawful purpose)https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx#:~:text=,distress%20to%20the%20petitioner%3B%20or.

6.  The Respondent’s attempts to obtain assistance from law enforcement and Adult
Protective Services were thwarted by the Petitioner’s misrepresentations, resulting in
multiple criminal charges being filed against the Respondent.  The prosecution has
since declined or dismissed these charges based on the same evidence attached hereto.

7.  The Respondent is facing imminent homelessness and loss of his business as a
result of the AHPO.  The order prevents him from accessing the residence and
workshop where his equipment is located.  Without relief, he will suffer irreparable
injury.


               III. ISSUES PRESENTED

1.  Did the Court misapply RCW 7.105.010 by finding harassment where the
    Respondent’s conduct served a legitimate purpose—namely accessing his
    residence, retrieving his property, and protecting his business and safety?

2.  Should the Court reconsider its credibility determinations in light of the newly
    discovered evidence showing that the Petitioner engaged in a pattern of coercive
    control and false accusations?

3.  Should the Respondent, as a vulnerable adult under RCW 74.34, be afforded
    enhanced protections and a full evidentiary hearing before being deprived of his
    home and livelihood?

4.  Does the newly discovered evidence constitute a substantial change of
    circumstances under RCW 7.105.500 warranting termination or modification of
the order?


               IV. ARGUMENT

A.  The Respondent’s Conduct Served a Legitimate Purpose and Therefore Does
    Not Constitute Unlawful Harassment.

        Washington’s anti‑harassment statute defines “unlawful harassment” as “a
knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that seriously
alarms, annoys, or harasses that person, and that serves no legitimate or lawful purpose”https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx#:~:text=,distress%20to%20the%20petitioner%3B%20or.  The Court’s August 16 2025 order overlooks critical facts showing
that the Respondent’s contacts with the Petitioner were lawful and necessary.  The
Respondent sought to retrieve tools and equipment needed to operate his business and
had every right to occupy his home.  The Petitioner had removed the locks and was
withholding the Respondent’s property.  As a matter of law, a landowner who
exercises his lawful right to access his property and protect his livelihood cannot be
found to have committed harassment.

B.  Newly Discovered Evidence and Misapprehension of Material Facts Warrant
    Reconsideration.

        Under CR 59(a)(3), a judgment may be reconsidered for “[n]ewly discovered
material evidence which the party could not with reasonable diligence have discovered
and produced at the trial.”  After the August 16 2025 hearing, the Respondent
recovered extensive chat logs and call recordings stored on cloud servers that
conclusively show the Petitioner’s pattern of emotional abuse, gaslighting, and
provocation.  The evidence shows that the Petitioner admitted to lying and
manipulating the Respondent, threatened to withhold property, and intentionally
caused confusion to provoke a reaction.  Such evidence not only undermines the
credibility of the Petitioner’s allegations but also constitutes a substantial change in
circumstances under RCW 7.105.500.

        In addition, the Respondent was not provided an opportunity to fully present
medical and law‑enforcement records at the hearing.  The December 2024 police
reports confirm that the Respondent was living in the garage following brain surgery,
that he attempted suicide, and that his alleged “harassment” occurred during an
emergency mental health crisishttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rlbu9GVfhJDsSCZ4PV4bPX9zj_cSf8LU.  These facts were not considered
and materially affect the outcome.

C.  The Court Erred by Failing to Consider the Respondent’s Vulnerable Adult
    Status and the Petitioner’s Abuse.

        The Vulnerable Adult Protection Act (RCW 74.34) extends protections to adults
who, because of physical or mental conditions, cannot care for themselveshttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sn_gQnFPY69cceTo8yMwBb35l4VGDCdk.
The Petitioner’s conduct—removing the Respondent from his home after brain
surgery, withholding medication, and causing financial ruin—constitutes abuse of a
vulnerable adult under RCW 74.34.020(2) and mental abuse under RCW 74.34.020(1)https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sn_gQnFPY69cceTo8yMwBb35l4VGDCdk.
Washington courts recognize that caregivers who isolate, manipulate, or deprive
vulnerable adults of property may be liable for exploitation.  At a minimum, the
Respondent’s vulnerable‑adult status requires the Court to apply heightened scrutiny
before upholding an order that deprives him of his residence and tools.

D.  Legal Authority Allows Termination or Modification of the Order.

        RCW 7.105.500 authorizes a respondent to seek modification or termination of
an anti‑harassment order when there has been “a substantial change in circumstances
such that the respondent is not likely to resume acts of unlawful harassment”https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx#:~:text=Modification%20or%20termination%E2%80%94Other%20than%20extreme,and%20vulnerable%20adult%20protection%20orders.  The statute directs the Court to consider factors including whether the
respondent exhibits suicidal ideation, has engaged in treatment, and has not
committed further harmful acts.  The Respondent’s medical and mental health
condition, his ongoing therapy, and the absence of any new incidents since the
October 2024 arrest support termination of the order.  Conversely, the Petitioner
continues to engage in coercive conduct.

        Further, an order can be vacated under CR 59(a)(8) for “error of law.”  By
finding harassment without a showing of a course of conduct that served no legitimate
purpose, the Court misapplied RCW 7.105.010.  The order also violates the
Respondent’s constitutional property rights without due process.


               V. CONCLUSION

        For all of the foregoing reasons, Respondent respectfully requests that the Court
reconsider its August 16 2025 order, vacate the anti‑harassment protection order, or,
in the alternative, schedule a full evidentiary hearing and grant such other relief as
may be just and equitable.


DATED this 22nd day of August, 2025.

Respectfully submitted,
