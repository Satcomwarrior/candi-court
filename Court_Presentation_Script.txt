Your Honor,

I am William Orley Miller Jr., appearing pro se. I am a vulnerable adult under RCW 74.34.020 due to a life-threatening carotid aneurysm, severe PTSD as a combat veteran, and my April 13, 2025 hospitalization. I respectfully request the Court’s immediate intervention to address ongoing harm by Respondent Candi Brightwell and her counsel.

First, I seek exclusive use of my residence for my medical recovery. Respondent has systematically locked me out, exploiting my vulnerability. Second, the June 27, 2025 trespass notice was obtained through fraud by Attorney Callahan, who misrepresented my testimony to law enforcement, violating my due process rights. I request its immediate vacating.

Third, Respondent’s behavior—manipulation, blame-shifting, and using her children in litigation—warrants a mental health evaluation for potential Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Fourth, her false claim of covering 90% of expenses is mathematically impossible; I request a forensic financial analysis to prove my contributions.

Fifth, I request sanctions of $87,500 against Attorney Callahan, with $3,500 daily penalties, and against Paralegal Taggart for misrepresenting court orders and obstructing my rights. Sixth, Respondent’s protection order petition should be dismissed with prejudice, and I request a one-year protection order for myself and consideration of an Extreme Risk Protection Order against her.

Seventh, I request sealing evidence of my adult content work to prevent misuse. Finally, I seek recognition of our Committed Intimate Relationship for equitable property division, supported by evidence of commingled assets.

Respondent’s counsel misled law enforcement, denied access to my business assets and necessities, and Respondent falsified evidence, including a 2024 photo. My General (Under Honorable Conditions) discharge was misrepresented as dishonorable. These actions constitute abuse and fraud.

I respectfully urge the Court to grant my motions to ensure my safety and rights. Thank you.

William Orley Miller Jr.
