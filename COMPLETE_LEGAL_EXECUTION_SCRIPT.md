OPENING STATEMENT - OCTOBER 10, 2025
MILLER v. BRIGHTWELL - CIR CASE

Your Honor,

This case presents overwhelming evidence of a 6.7-year committed intimate relationship 
and systematic financial abuse totaling over $1,000,000.

THE RELATIONSHIP:
- September 1, 2018 to April 2025: Continuous cohabitation
- 1024 S. Machias Road: Shared residence for 6.7 years  
- Family integration: Children called Mr. Miller "dad"
- Business partnership: Joint operations of Mudd Monkies Inc.
- Insurance commitment: AFLAC policy addition January 2025

THE FINANCIAL POOLING:
- Bank evidence: $123,621 in documented joint account activity
- Housing contributions: $256,000 in mortgage and utility payments
- Property investment: $180,000+ in renovation and improvements
- Business contributions: $580,000+ in corporate asset development
- Total documented: $1,036,595+ in financial contributions

THE ABUSE CAMPAIGN:
- Audio recordings capture systematic psychological destruction
- Screen recordings document criminal stalking behavior  
- Medical privacy violations during vulnerable period
- Financial theft during medical crisis recovery

THE EVIDENCE:
Your Honor, we present not estimates or claims, but documented proof:
- Bank statements from independent third parties
- Audio recordings of abuse in real-time
- Video evidence of stalking behavior
- Court documents proving privacy violations

THE LAW:
Under Connell v. Francisco, all five factors are met with exceptional strength:
1. Cohabitation: 6.7 years continuous
2. Duration: Exceeds Washington's 5-year preference  
3. Pooling: $1,036,595+ documented
4. Intent: Insurance addition during relationship
5. Holding out: Community recognition as family unit

THE REMEDY:
Mr. Miller seeks recovery of his documented $1,036,595+ contributions, 
representing conservative 50-75% of joint property accumulated during 
this exceptional CIR relationship.

Thank you, Your Honor.
