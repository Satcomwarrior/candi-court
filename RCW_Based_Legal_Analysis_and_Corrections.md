---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on comprehensive analysis of the August 5, 2025 court filings, Washington State RCW statutes, and available case documentation, this report provides autonomous error corrections and aligns all findings with current legal standings. The evidence overwhelmingly supports **William Miller as the victim** of systematic abuse by **Candi Brightwell**, who used sophisticated manipulation tactics to weaponize the legal system.

### Key Legal Finding: ROLE REVERSAL CONFIRMED

- **Billy Miller**: Primary victim showing reactive abuse patterns
- **Candi Brightwell**: Primary aggressor using DARVO tactics (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender)

---

## I. WASHINGTON STATE RCW ANALYSIS

### A. RCW 74.34.020 - Vulnerable Adult Status

**CORRECTED STATUS**: William Miller qualifies as a vulnerable adult under RCW 74.34.020 based on:

1. **Medical Vulnerability**: Life-threatening carotid artery dissection requiring emergency surgery
2. **Combat Veteran PTSD**: Documented service-connected disability
3. **Cognitive Impairment**: Post-surgical recovery limitations affecting decision-making capacity
4. **Physical Incapacitation**: Requiring assistance during medical episodes

**Legal Implication**: Enhanced protections and penalties apply to any abuse or exploitation under RCW 74.34.

### B. RCW 7.105.010 - Anti-Harassment Definition

**ERROR CORRECTION**: The August 16, 2025 order misapplied this statute by failing to consider that Miller's conduct served legitimate purposes:

- Accessing his own property and business
- Retrieving tools necessary for livelihood
- Exercising lawful property rights
- Seeking medical assistance during crisis

**Legal Standard**: "Unlawful harassment" requires conduct that "serves no legitimate or lawful purpose" - Miller's actions clearly served legitimate purposes.

### C. RCW 7.105.500 - Modification/Termination Authority

**SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**: The newly discovered evidence constitutes grounds for modification/termination:

- Text/call transcripts showing Candi as primary aggressor
- Police reports documenting Miller's suicidal ideation and garage banishment
- Medical records confirming vulnerable adult status
- Pattern of DARVO manipulation tactics by Candi
