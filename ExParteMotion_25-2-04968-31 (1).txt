COMES NOW Petitioner, William Orley Miller Jr., pro se, respectfully moving this Court for emergency ex parte relief based on:

1. **Fabricated Evidence**: Respondent’s June 28, 2025 claim of modem hacking using a September 2024 "Prince Charles" screenshot.

3. **Hypocrisy**: Respondent’s "LegsNassxxx" one of many cam profiles contradict her condemnation of Petitioner’s cam work.  
4. **Child Weaponization**: Respondent’s use of her oldest and youngest daughters to manipulate Petitioner and leverage court/police interactions, implying parental unfitness.  
5. **Narcissistic Patterns**: Gaslighting, projection, and blame-shifting in declarations, per objective analysis.
